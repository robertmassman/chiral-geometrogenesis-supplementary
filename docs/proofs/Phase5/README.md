## Key Results

- The metric emerges from chiral field correlations
- Einstein equations derived via **two independent routes**:
  - Thermodynamic (5.2.3): Jacobson's δQ = TδS approach
  - **Non-thermodynamic (5.2.1b): Fixed-point + Lovelock uniqueness** — Resolves the "open problem" noted in 5.2.1
- Newton's constant G derived from chiral parameters
- Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S = A/(4*l_P^2) emerges naturally
