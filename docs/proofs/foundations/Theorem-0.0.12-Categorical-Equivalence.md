## 1. Statement

**Theorem 0.0.12 (SU(3)-Stella Categorical Equivalence)**

> The category **A₂-Dec** of A₂-decorated polyhedra satisfying the geometric realization conditions (GR1)-(GR3) is equivalent to the category **W(A₂)-Mod** of S₃-sets with A₂ weight structure.
>
> In particular: The abstract Lie-algebraic data of SU(3) (roots, weights, Weyl group) and the concrete geometric structure of the stella octangula determine each other uniquely up to natural isomorphism.

**Corollary 0.0.12.1 (Reconstruction)**
> SU(3)'s Cartan data can be reconstructed from the stella octangula:
> - Edge labels → root vectors in Φ(A₂)
> - Vertex labels → weights in h*
> - Symmetry group → Weyl group W = S₃

**Corollary 0.0.12.2 (Universal Property)**
> The stella octangula is not merely the unique minimal realization of SU(3) — it is the universal geometric encoding of SU(3)'s Cartan structure.

## 3. Motivation

### 3.1 The Gap Between "Realizes" and "Is"

Prior work establishes:
- **Theorem 0.0.2 §9.6:** The stella octangula is the *initial object* in a category of geometric realizations
- **Theorem 0.0.3:** The stella is the *unique minimal* 3D geometric realization of SU(3)
- **Theorem 1.1.1:** There is an *explicit bijection* between stella vertices and SU(3) weights

However, these results leave a gap. Being an initial object or having a bijection is not the same as categorical equivalence. The claim "SU(3) IS the stella" requires demonstrating that the two structures encode *exactly the same information* — that knowing one is equivalent to knowing the other.

### 3.2 What Categorical Equivalence Means

Two categories C and D are **equivalent** if there exist:
1. Functors F: C → D and G: D → C
2. Natural isomorphisms η: Id_C → G∘F and ε: F∘G → Id_D

This is stronger than:
- Bijection on objects (ignores morphisms)
- Initial/terminal objects (only one direction)
- Isomorphism (too strict — requires equality on objects)

Equivalence means the categories have the same "categorical structure" — the same patterns of objects and morphisms, even if the concrete objects differ.

### 3.3 Physical Significance

If A₂-Dec ≃ W(A₂)-Mod, then:
- The geometric structure of the stella *contains* all information about SU(3)'s Cartan data
- The algebraic structure of SU(3) *contains* all information needed to reconstruct the stella
- There is no loss of information in either direction

This justifies saying "SU(3) IS the stella" in a precise mathematical sense.

## 4. Category Definitions

### 4.1 Category A₂-Dec (Geometric Side)

**Objects:** Tuples (P, ι, φ) where:
- P is a finite polyhedral complex embedded in ℝ³
- ι: V(P) → h* is a weight labeling of vertices
- φ: Aut(P) ↠ W(A₂) is a surjective group homomorphism

satisfying the geometric realization conditions from Definition 0.0.0:

**(GR1) Weight Correspondence:** The image ι(V(P)) contains all weights of **3** ⊕ **3̄**.

**(GR2) Symmetry Preservation:** For all σ ∈ Aut(P) and v ∈ V(P):
$$\iota(\sigma(v)) = \phi(\sigma) \cdot \iota(v)$$

**(GR3) Conjugation Compatibility:** There exists an involution τ ∈ Aut(P) such that:
$$\iota(\tau(v)) = -\iota(v) \quad \forall v \in V(P)$$

**(GR4) Minimality:** The polyhedral complex P has exactly 8 vertices:
- 6 vertices with non-zero weights (one for each weight in **3** ⊕ **3̄**)
- 2 vertices with weight 0 (apex vertices)

*Note:* This minimality condition is not independent — it follows from (GR1)-(GR3) together with finiteness and the surjectivity of φ. We include it explicitly for clarity. See Lemma 0.0.12e in the Derivation file for the proof.

**Morphisms:** A morphism f: (P, ι, φ) → (P', ι', φ') is a PL-homeomorphism f: P → P' such that:

**(M1) Weight Preservation:**
$$\iota' \circ f = \iota$$

**(M2) Symmetry Compatibility:** For all σ ∈ Aut(P):
$$\phi'(f \circ \sigma \circ f^{-1}) = \phi(\sigma)$$

**Identity and Composition:** Identity is the identity map; composition is function composition.

### 4.2 Category W(A₂)-Mod (Algebraic Side)

**Objects:** Tuples (X, ρ, w, E) where:
- X is a finite set (abstract "vertices")
- ρ: S₃ × X → X is an S₃-action
- w: X → h* is a weight function
- E: X × X → Φ ∪ {0} is an edge function

satisfying:

**(W1) Weight Completeness:** The image w(X) contains all weights of **3** ⊕ **3̄**.

**(W2) Weyl Equivariance:** For all s ∈ S₃ and x ∈ X:
$$w(s \cdot x) = s \cdot w(x)$$
where S₃ acts on h* as the Weyl group.

**(W3) Edge-Root Compatibility:** For all x, y ∈ X:
- If E(x,y) ≠ 0, then E(x,y) = w(x) - w(y) ∈ Φ
- E(x,y) = -E(y,x)

**(W4) Conjugation:** There exists an S₃-equivariant involution τ on X such that w(τ(x)) = -w(x).

**(W5) Minimality:** The set X has exactly 8 elements:
- 6 elements with non-zero weights (one for each weight in **3** ⊕ **3̄**)
- 2 elements with weight 0 (corresponding to apex vertices)

*Note:* As with (GR4), this minimality follows from (W1)-(W4). See Lemma 0.0.12e in the Derivation file.

**Morphisms:** A morphism g: (X, ρ, w, E) → (X', ρ', w', E') is a function g: X → X' such that:

**(N1) S₃-Equivariance:** g(s · x) = s · g(x) for all s ∈ S₃, x ∈ X

**(N2) Weight Preservation:** w' ∘ g = w

**(N3) Edge Preservation:** E'(g(x), g(y)) = E(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X

## 5. Functor Constructions

### 5.1 Functor F: A₂-Dec → W(A₂)-Mod

**On Objects:**

Given (P, ι, φ), define F(P, ι, φ) = (X, ρ, w, E) where:
- X = V(P) (vertex set)
- ρ: S₃ × X → X is defined by: for s ∈ S₃, choose σ ∈ Aut(P) with φ(σ) = s, then s · v = σ(v)
- w = ι (the weight labeling)
- E(v, v') = ι(v) - ι(v') if {v, v'} is an edge in P and this difference is in Φ; otherwise E(v, v') = 0

**On Morphisms:**

Given f: (P, ι, φ) → (P', ι', φ'), define F(f): F(P, ι, φ) → F(P', ι', φ') as the restriction of f to vertices.

**Verification:** See Derivation file §2.

### 5.2 Functor G: W(A₂)-Mod → A₂-Dec

**On Objects:**

Given (X, ρ, w, E), define G(X, ρ, w, E) = (P, ι, φ) where:

1. **Vertex placement:** For each x ∈ X, place a vertex at position determined by the Killing metric:
   - If w(x) is a weight of **3**: place at corresponding fundamental weight position
   - If w(x) is a weight of **3̄**: place at corresponding anti-fundamental position
   - If w(x) = 0: place at apex position (±r along the axis perpendicular to weight plane)

2. **Edge construction:** Add edge {v_x, v_y} if E(x,y) ≠ 0

3. **Face construction:** For each triple (x, y, z) with E(x,y), E(y,z), E(z,x) all nonzero and forming a triangular face, add the corresponding 2-simplex

4. **Weight labeling:** ι(v_x) = w(x)

5. **Symmetry map:** φ: Aut(P) → S₃ is the unique surjection induced by the S₃-action on X

**On Morphisms:**

Given g: (X, ρ, w, E) → (X', ρ', w', E'), the morphism G(g): G(X, ρ, w, E) → G(X', ρ', w', E') is the unique PL-homeomorphism extending g on vertices.

**Verification:** See Derivation file §3.

## 6. Natural Isomorphisms

### 6.1 Unit η: Id_{A₂-Dec} → G ∘ F

For each object (P, ι, φ) in A₂-Dec, define:
$$\eta_{(P,\iota,\phi)}: (P, \iota, \phi) \to G(F(P, \iota, \phi))$$

This is the identity on vertices, extended to a PL-homeomorphism on P.

**Key Lemma (0.0.12c):** This extension exists and is unique because the polyhedral structure of P is uniquely determined by its vertex positions, edge structure, and symmetry group (Theorem 0.0.3).

### 6.2 Counit ε: F ∘ G → Id_{W(A₂)-Mod}

For each object (X, ρ, w, E) in W(A₂)-Mod, define:
$$\varepsilon_{(X,\rho,w,E)}: F(G(X, \rho, w, E)) \to (X, \rho, w, E)$$

This is the identity on the underlying set X.

**Key Lemma (0.0.12d):** The identity preserves all structure because G reconstructs exactly the original S₃-action and edge function from the geometry.

## 7. Supporting Lemmas

### Lemma 0.0.12a (Weight Determination)

> A point in h* is uniquely determined by its distances to the 6 roots in Φ(A₂).

*Sketch:* The roots span h*, so any point is determined by its inner products with the roots. Distance information encodes these inner products.

### Lemma 0.0.12b (Weyl Orbit Uniqueness)

> The orbit of any nonzero weight under W = S₃ uniquely determines its position in h* (up to Weyl chamber choice).

*Sketch:* W acts transitively on Weyl chambers. Within a fixed chamber, orbit structure determines position.

### Lemma 0.0.12c (Geometric Reconstruction)

> Given vertex positions satisfying (GR1)-(GR3) and edge data, the polyhedral complex is uniquely determined up to PL-homeomorphism.

*Sketch:* By Theorem 0.0.3, the stella is the unique minimal realization. The edge and symmetry data determine the complex.

### Lemma 0.0.12d (Morphism Extension)

> Any S₃-equivariant, weight-preserving, edge-preserving map between vertex sets extends uniquely to a PL-homeomorphism.

*Sketch:* Vertex maps determine edge maps; triangular faces are determined by their boundary edges; the extension is forced by simplicial structure.

## 8. Comparison with Standard Approaches

### 8.1 Root Datum Perspective

The standard algebraic approach to SU(3) uses the **root datum**:
- Character lattice X = ℤ²
- Cocharacter lattice X∨ = ℤ²
- Roots Φ and coroots Φ∨
- Perfect pairing ⟨-,-⟩: X × X∨ → ℤ

Our category W(A₂)-Mod encodes this data in a concrete, combinatorial form suitable for geometric realization.

### 8.2 Representation Category

The representation category Rep(SU(3)) is much richer — it includes all finite-dimensional representations, not just **3** ⊕ **3̄**.

**Future Work (Theorem 0.0.12):** A stronger result would show that the full group SU(3) can be reconstructed from the stella via Tannaka-Krein duality. This would require encoding the tensor product structure in the geometric data.

### 8.3 Initial Object vs. Equivalence

Theorem 0.0.2 §9.6 established the stella as an *initial object* in a category of geometric realizations. An initial object has a unique morphism *to* every other object, but this is a one-directional property.

Categorical equivalence is bidirectional: functors go in both directions, and their compositions are naturally isomorphic to the identity. This is a much stronger relationship.

## 9. Physical Interpretation

### 9.1 What "SU(3) IS the Stella" Means

With Theorem 0.0.12, we can make precise the informal claim:

> "SU(3) **is** the stella octangula in the sense that the category of SU(3) Cartan structures (root system, weight lattice, Weyl group) is equivalent to the category of stella-type geometric realizations."

**Important Scope Clarification:**

This equivalence operates at the level of **Cartan data** (discrete/combinatorial structures), not the full continuous Lie group. Specifically:

| Encoded in Theorem 0.0.12 | NOT encoded (requires future work) |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Root system Φ(A₂) | Continuous group parameters |
| Weight lattice | Full representation category Rep(SU(3)) |
| Weyl group W = S₃ | Tensor product structure |
| Cartan matrix | Fiber functor |

The equivalence means:
1. Every piece of Cartan data for SU(3) is encoded geometrically in the stella
2. Every geometric feature of the stella corresponds to algebraic data of SU(3)
3. The encoding is natural — structure-preserving maps on one side correspond to structure-preserving maps on the other

Recovery of the full Lie group SU(3) requires Theorem 0.0.12 (Tannaka Reconstruction), which is future work.

### 9.2 Implications for Chiral Geometrogenesis

In the framework:
- Fields live on the stella octangula boundary ∂S
- SU(3) gauge symmetry governs field interactions
- The categorical equivalence shows these are the same thing from different perspectives

**Precise Statement:** The stella encodes SU(3)'s **Cartan structure** (roots, weights, Weyl group). This is the combinatorial skeleton that determines:
- Which representations exist
- How the Weyl group acts on weights
- The edge/root correspondence

The stella is not merely a "model" of SU(3) Cartan data — it IS SU(3) Cartan data in the precise sense that knowing its geometric structure is equivalent to knowing SU(3)'s Cartan-level algebraic structure.

**Note on "Gauge Symmetry":** This theorem establishes the Weyl group W = S₃ action, which is the discrete part of gauge symmetry. The full continuous gauge group SU(3) with its 8 generators (gluons) requires additional structure beyond Cartan data — specifically, the recovery of the Lie algebra su(3) from the root system, which is a classical reconstruction (Serre's theorem) not explicitly performed here.

## 10. Future Work

### 10.1 Theorem 0.0.12 (Tannaka Reconstruction)

A stronger result would establish that the full compact Lie group SU(3) — not just its Cartan data — can be reconstructed from the stella octangula via Tannaka-Krein duality.

This would require:
1. Encoding tensor products of representations in stella geometry
2. Showing the fiber functor ω: Rep(SU(3)) → Vec is recoverable
3. Applying Tannaka reconstruction: SU(3) ≅ Aut⊗(ω)

### 10.2 Lean Formalization

The categorical equivalence should be formalized in Lean 4 using Mathlib's CategoryTheory library:
- Define A₂-Dec as a category
- Define W(A₂)-Mod as a category
- Construct the functors F and G
- Prove the natural isomorphisms

### 10.3 Generalization to SU(N)

The construction should generalize:
- A₂-Dec → A_{N-1}-Dec
- W(A₂)-Mod → W(A_{N-1})-Mod
- The unique minimal geometric realization is the appropriate generalization of the stella
