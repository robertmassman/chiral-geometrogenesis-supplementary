# Theorem 0.0.11: Lorentz Boost Emergence from Chiral Field Dynamics

## Status: ✅ VERIFIED — COMPLETES LORENTZ INVARIANCE DERIVATION

**Purpose:** This theorem extends Theorem 0.0.8 (Emergent Rotational Symmetry) to include Lorentz boosts, completing the derivation of full Lorentz invariance SO(3,1) from the discrete framework. Combined with Theorem 0.0.8, this establishes that the full Poincaré group emerges as an effective symmetry.

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Theorem 0.0.8 (Emergent Rotational Symmetry) — SO(3) from O_h
- ✅ Theorem 0.2.2 (Internal Time Parameter Emergence) — Time from phases
- ✅ Theorem 5.2.1 (Emergent Metric) — Metric from stress-energy
- ✅ Theorem 5.2.3 (Einstein Equations as Thermodynamic Identity)
- ✅ Theorem 0.0.7 (Lorentz Violation Bounds) — Quantitative constraints

**What This Theorem Establishes:**
- How time dilation emerges from position-dependent phase frequency
- Why the speed of light is invariant (emergent from field propagation)
- The mechanism by which boosts mix space and time
- Quantitative suppression of Lorentz-violating effects: $(E/E_P)^2$

## 0. Resolution of the Circularity Problem

**CRITICAL: This section addresses reviewer feedback on circular dependencies.**

### The Apparent Circularity

A reader might object that Section 3.1 uses a Lorentz-form Lagrangian:
$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu\chi^* \partial_\nu\chi - V(\chi)$$

This APPEARS to assume Lorentz invariance by using a metric $g^{\mu\nu}$ with Lorentzian signature.

### Why This Is NOT Circular

The resolution is that the derivation proceeds in STAGES:

**STAGE A: Pre-Metric (No Spacetime Metric Assumed)**

In this stage (before Section 3), we have:
- Stella octangula geometry (Definition 0.1.1) — purely algebraic structure
- Three color fields with relative phases (Definition 0.1.2) — no spacetime
- Internal time parameter λ (Theorem 0.2.2) — from phase evolution, not spacetime
- Pre-geometric energy functional (Theorem 0.2.4) — energy without Noether/spacetime

**STAGE B: Metric Bootstrap (Theorem 5.2.1)**

The metric is DERIVED, not assumed:
1. Start with pre-geometric stress-energy from Theorem 0.2.4
2. The metric ansatz $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + \kappa T_{\mu\nu}$ is a bootstrap equation
3. Self-consistency via Banach fixed-point (Theorem 5.2.1 §8)
4. Lorentzian signature is FORCED by:
   - Energy positivity (kinetic terms must be positive)
   - Causality (wave equation must be hyperbolic)
   - Unitarity (probability must be conserved)

**STAGE C: Lorentz Invariance as Output (This Theorem)**

Once the metric exists:
1. The Lagrangian form $g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\chi\partial_\nu\chi$ is now JUSTIFIED
2. Lorentz boosts are the isometries of this derived metric
3. The propagation speed c comes from the metric structure

### The Non-Circular Derivation Chain

```
Stage A: Pre-Metric Structure
├── Stella geometry (no metric)
├── Phase evolution ∂_λχ = iχ (Theorem 3.0.2)
├── Pre-geometric energy E[χ] (Theorem 0.2.4)
└── Stress-energy T_μν from energy gradient

Stage B: Metric Bootstrap (Theorem 5.2.1)
├── Bootstrap equation: g = η + κT[g]
├── Fixed-point solution exists (Banach)
├── Signature (−,+,+,+) forced by:
│   ├── Energy positivity → time/space opposite signs
│   ├── Causality → hyperbolic, not elliptic
│   └── Unitarity → |ψ|² conserved, no exponential growth
└── Output: Minkowski metric η_μν

Stage C: Lorentz Invariance (This Theorem)
├── Metric isometries = SO(3,1) (mathematical fact)
├── Boosts are generated by K_i
├── Invariant speed c from metric structure
└── Time dilation from metric interval
```

### Key Point

**The Lagrangian in §3.1 is NOT the starting point — it is the RESULT of Stage B.**

We write it in Lorentz form because by §3 we have ALREADY derived (in Theorem 5.2.1) that the metric has Lorentzian signature. The apparent circularity is an artifact of presentation, not logic.

## 1. Statement

**Theorem 0.0.11 (Lorentz Boost Emergence)**

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the emergent spacetime from Theorem 5.2.1, with:
- Spatial symmetry: Effective SO(3) from discrete O_h (Theorem 0.0.8)
- Time coordinate: $t = \lambda/\omega_0$ from phase evolution (Theorem 0.2.2)
- Metric: $g_{\mu\nu}$ from stress-energy (Theorem 5.2.1)

Then:

**(a) Invariant Speed:** There exists a universal speed $c$ such that all massless excitations of the chiral field propagate at speed $c$:
$$v_{field} = c \quad \text{(for massless modes)}$$

**(b) Boost Symmetry:** For observers in relative motion at velocity $v < c$, the physical laws are equivalent, with coordinate transformations:
$$x' = \gamma(x - vt), \quad t' = \gamma\left(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\right)$$

where $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.

**(c) Time Dilation:** Moving clocks run slow:
$$\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t_0$$

This emerges from the position-dependent phase frequency.

**(d) Lorentz Violation Bounds:** Deviations from exact Lorentz invariance are bounded:
$$\frac{\delta c}{c} \lesssim \left(\frac{E}{E_P}\right)^2$$

consistent with Theorem 0.0.8.

## 2. Background: The Boost Gap

### 2.1 What Theorem 0.0.9 Established

Theorem 0.0.9 showed:
- Rotational symmetry SO(3) emerges from discrete O_h
- Suppression factor: $(a/L)^2$
- Mechanism: Coarse-graining and Wilsonian RG

### 2.2 What Was Missing

Rotations alone give SO(3). Full Lorentz invariance requires:
- Boosts (mixing space and time)
- Invariant speed $c$
- Time dilation and length contraction

### 2.3 The Key Question

How do boosts emerge when:
1. Time emerges from phase evolution (Theorem 0.2.2)
2. Space has effective SO(3) symmetry (Theorem 0.0.8)
3. These seem to be separate constructions

---

## 3. Derivation: The Invariant Speed

### 3.1 The Chiral Field Lagrangian

The chiral field Lagrangian density (from Theorem 5.1.1) is:
$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu\chi^* \partial_\nu\chi - V(\chi)$$

Using the emergent flat metric $\eta_{\mu\nu} = \text{diag}(-1, +1, +1, +1)$:
$$\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{2}|\partial_t \chi|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|\nabla\chi|^2 - V(\chi)$$

The Euler-Lagrange equation gives:
$$\partial_t^2\chi - \nabla^2\chi + V'(|\chi|^2)\chi = 0$$

For small perturbations $\delta\chi$ around the VEV $\langle\chi\rangle = v$:
$$\partial_t^2\delta\chi - \nabla^2\delta\chi + m^2\delta\chi = 0$$

where $m^2 = V''(v^2)$.

**For massless modes** ($m = 0$):
$$\partial_t^2\delta\chi = \nabla^2\delta\chi$$

The propagation speed is:
$$c_{prop} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{coefficient of } \nabla^2}{\text{coefficient of } \partial_t^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1}} = 1 \text{ (natural units)}$$

### 3.2 Why the Metric Must Have This Form

**Theorem 3.2.1 (Lorentzian Signature from Consistency):**

The emergent metric must have Lorentzian signature $(-,+,+,+)$ with equal magnitude coefficients for time and space derivatives. This is DERIVED, not assumed.

**Proof (from Theorem 5.2.1 §13.1):**

1. **Energy Positivity:** The energy functional is:
   $$E = \int d^3x \left[\frac{1}{2}|\partial_t\chi|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|\nabla\chi|^2 + V(\chi)\right]$$

   For $E \geq 0$, the kinetic terms must have the SAME sign. This forces:
   - Time derivatives: coefficient +1 in energy
   - Space derivatives: coefficient +1 in energy

   In the Lagrangian (L = T - V), this translates to opposite signs in the metric.

2. **Causality (Hyperbolicity):** The wave equation must be hyperbolic for wave-like propagation:
   $$\partial_t^2 - c^2\nabla^2 = 0 \quad \text{(hyperbolic, waves propagate)}$$

   Euclidean signature would give:
   $$\partial_\tau^2 + c^2\nabla^2 = 0 \quad \text{(elliptic, no propagation)}$$

3. **Unitarity (Probability Conservation):** Phase evolution $\chi(\lambda) = \chi_0 e^{i\Phi(\lambda)}$ gives:
   $$|\chi(\lambda)|^2 = |\chi_0|^2 \quad \text{(conserved)}$$

   Euclidean signature would give exponential growth/decay, violating unitarity.

**Conclusion:** The Lorentzian signature with equal coefficients (hence $c = 1$ in natural units) is FORCED by consistency requirements. ∎

### 3.3 Why the Invariant Speed is Universal

**Theorem 3.2.2 (Invariant Speed Emergence):**

The speed $c$ at which massless chiral field excitations propagate is:
1. Independent of direction (isotropy)
2. Independent of the motion of the source
3. The same for all massless particles

**Proof:**

1. **Isotropy from Theorem 0.0.9:** The spatial part of the wave equation has effective SO(3) symmetry (from discrete O_h), so propagation speed is direction-independent to $(a/L)^2$ precision.

2. **Source-independence from linearity:** The wave equation is linear. The superposition principle ensures that the speed depends only on the field properties, not the source motion.

3. **Universality from unique null cone:** The emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ has a unique null cone defined by $g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu = 0$. All massless particles travel on this cone because they all couple to the same metric. ∎

### 3.4 The Speed $c$ in Physical Units

From Theorem 0.2.2, time emerges as:
$$t = \frac{\lambda}{\omega_0}$$

The natural speed in physical units is:
$$c = \frac{\ell_P}{t_P} = 2.998 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$$

This is the ratio of the Planck length to the Planck time — both derived from the same fundamental constants $(G, \hbar, c)$.

## 4. Derivation: Boost Symmetry from Metric Structure

### 4.1 The Logical Chain

The boost symmetry derivation follows this chain:

```
1. Chiral field dynamics (Phase 0)
      ↓
2. Energy positivity + causality + unitarity (§3.2)
      ↓
3. Lorentzian signature REQUIRED (Theorem 5.2.1 §13.1)
      ↓
4. Metric takes form η_μν = diag(-1,+1,+1,+1)
      ↓
5. SO(3,1) is the isometry group of η_μν (this section)
      ↓
6. Boost symmetry emerges
```

**Key Point:** Boost symmetry is not assumed — it follows from the metric structure, which itself is derived from consistency requirements on the chiral field.

### 4.2 The Emergent Metric

From Theorem 5.2.1, the metric emerges from the chiral field:
$$g_{\mu\nu}^{eff}(x) = \eta_{\mu\nu} + \kappa \langle T_{\mu\nu}(x) \rangle + O(\kappa^2)$$

In the weak-field limit (far from sources), this reduces to Minkowski:
$$g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

**Why this specific form?** From §3.2:
- The signature $(-,+,+,+)$ is forced by energy positivity and causality
- The equal magnitude of coefficients (all ±1) is forced by isotropy (Theorem 0.0.8)

### 4.3 Boost Transformations as Metric Isometries

**Theorem 4.3.1 (Lorentz Boost as Metric Isometry):**

Once the Minkowski metric is established, the Lorentz group SO(3,1) follows mathematically as its isometry group.

**Proof:**

1. **Isometry definition:** A coordinate transformation $x^\mu \to x'^\mu = \Lambda^\mu_\nu x^\nu$ is an isometry if it preserves the metric:
   $$\eta_{\mu\nu} = \Lambda^\alpha_\mu \Lambda^\beta_\nu \eta_{\alpha\beta}$$

2. **Isometry group:** The set of all such transformations forms a group. For $\eta_{\mu\nu} = \text{diag}(-1,+1,+1,+1)$, this group is:
   $$O(3,1) = \{\Lambda : \Lambda^T \eta \Lambda = \eta\}$$

   Restricting to orientation-preserving transformations with det = +1:
   $$SO^+(3,1) = \text{proper orthochronous Lorentz group}$$

3. **Lie algebra decomposition:** The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(3,1)$ decomposes as a vector space:
   $$\mathfrak{so}(3,1) = \mathfrak{so}(3) \oplus \mathfrak{boost}$$

   where $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ generates rotations and $\mathfrak{boost}$ generates boosts. (Note: This is NOT a direct product of groups due to non-commuting boost generators.)

4. **Explicit boost in x-direction:**
   $$\Lambda_x(\beta) = \begin{pmatrix} \gamma & -\beta\gamma & 0 & 0 \\ -\beta\gamma & \gamma & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

   where $\beta = v/c$ and $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$.

**Verification:** $\Lambda^T \eta \Lambda = \eta$ can be checked directly:
- (0,0) entry: $\gamma^2(-1) + \beta^2\gamma^2(+1) = -\gamma^2(1-\beta^2) = -1$ ✓
- (1,1) entry: $\beta^2\gamma^2(-1) + \gamma^2(+1) = \gamma^2(1-\beta^2) = +1$ ✓
- Off-diagonal entries vanish by similar calculation ✓ ∎

**Remark 4.3.2 (General Boosts from x-Boost):**

Only the x-boost $\Lambda_x(\beta)$ is shown explicitly above. General boosts in arbitrary directions follow by conjugation with rotations:

$$\Lambda_{\hat{n}}(\beta) = R(\hat{n} \to \hat{x}) \cdot \Lambda_x(\beta) \cdot R(\hat{x} \to \hat{n})$$

where $R(\hat{n} \to \hat{x})$ is the rotation taking direction $\hat{n}$ to the x-axis.

**Explicit form for boost in direction $\hat{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$:**
$$\Lambda_{\hat{n}}(\beta) = \begin{pmatrix}
\gamma & -\beta\gamma n_x & -\beta\gamma n_y & -\beta\gamma n_z \\
-\beta\gamma n_x & 1 + (\gamma-1)n_x^2 & (\gamma-1)n_x n_y & (\gamma-1)n_x n_z \\
-\beta\gamma n_y & (\gamma-1)n_x n_y & 1 + (\gamma-1)n_y^2 & (\gamma-1)n_y n_z \\
-\beta\gamma n_z & (\gamma-1)n_x n_z & (\gamma-1)n_y n_z & 1 + (\gamma-1)n_z^2
\end{pmatrix}$$

This follows from the Lie algebra structure: any boost generator $K_{\hat{n}} = n_x K_x + n_y K_y + n_z K_z$ can be rotated to $K_x$.

**Verification:** See [verification/foundations/theorem_0_0_11_verification.py](../../../verification/foundations/theorem_0_0_11_verification.py) for numerical verification that $\Lambda_{\hat{n}}^T \eta \Lambda_{\hat{n}} = \eta$ for arbitrary directions.

### 4.4 Physical Interpretation

The boost symmetry means:
- An observer moving at constant velocity sees the same physics
- The chiral field equations have the same form in the boosted frame
- There is no preferred reference frame (relativity principle)

**Connection to Theorem 0.0.8:** Rotational symmetry SO(3) was derived from discrete O_h via coarse-graining. Combined with boosts (derived here from metric structure), we obtain the full Lorentz group SO(3,1).

## 5. Derivation: Time Dilation from Phase Frequency

### 5.1 Time as Oscillation Counting (Theorem 0.2.2)

From Theorem 0.2.2, time emerges from phase oscillation counting:
$$t = \frac{\lambda}{\omega_0} = \frac{N \cdot 2\pi}{\omega_0}$$

where:
- $\lambda$ is the internal parameter (accumulated phase in radians)
- $N$ is the number of complete oscillation cycles
- $\omega_0$ is the characteristic angular frequency

A clock at rest measures time by counting oscillations of the chiral field:
$$\Delta t_{rest} = \frac{N}{\omega_0} \cdot 2\pi$$

### 5.2 Moving Clock Frequency: Non-Circular Derivation

**Theorem 5.2.1 (Time Dilation from Phase Mechanism):**

A clock moving at velocity $v$ relative to the lab frame has effective phase frequency:
$$\omega_{moving} = \omega_0 \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \omega_0 / \gamma$$

This leads to time dilation:
$$\Delta t_{lab} = \gamma \cdot \Delta \tau_{proper}$$

**Proof (from phase frequency mechanism, NOT from E = γmc²):**

1. **Phase evolution in rest frame:** The chiral field evolves as:
   $$\chi(\lambda) = \chi_0 e^{i\Phi(\lambda)} = \chi_0 e^{i\omega_0 t}$$

   A clock at rest counts oscillations at rate $\omega_0$.

2. **Moving clock in lab frame:** A clock moving at velocity $v$ carries its phase oscillator with it. The lab observer sees the phase of the moving clock.

3. **Transverse Doppler Effect:** Unlike longitudinal Doppler (which depends on direction), the transverse Doppler effect is purely relativistic and direction-independent:
   - The moving clock's internal oscillations are time-dilated as seen from the lab
   - The relationship between proper time $\tau$ and lab time $t$ is determined by the metric interval

4. **Metric interval argument:** The invariant interval is:
   $$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 = -c^2 d\tau^2$$

   For a moving clock: $dx = v \, dt$, so:
   $$-c^2 d\tau^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + v^2 dt^2 = -(c^2 - v^2) dt^2$$

   Therefore:
   $$d\tau = dt \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = dt / \gamma$$

5. **Phase frequency transformation:** The moving clock counts $N$ oscillations in proper time $\Delta\tau$:
   $$N = \omega_0 \cdot \Delta\tau = \omega_0 \cdot \Delta t_{lab} / \gamma$$

   As seen from the lab, the effective frequency is:
   $$\omega_{moving} = \frac{N}{\Delta t_{lab}} = \frac{\omega_0}{\gamma}$$

6. **Time dilation result:** For the same number of oscillations $N$:
   $$\Delta t_{lab} = \frac{N}{\omega_{moving}} = \frac{N}{\omega_0/\gamma} = \gamma \cdot \frac{N}{\omega_0} = \gamma \cdot \Delta\tau$$ ∎

**Why this is NOT circular:**
- We use the metric interval $ds^2$, which is DERIVED (§3.2, §4.2)
- We do NOT use $E = \gamma mc^2$ or any other SR kinematic result
- The derivation follows directly from the phase counting definition of time

### 5.3 The Physical Mechanism

In the chiral framework, time dilation has a concrete physical interpretation:

1. **Time IS oscillation counting:** From Theorem 0.2.2, $t = \lambda/\omega$
2. **Moving clocks traverse less proper time:** The metric interval ensures that a moving clock accumulates fewer oscillations as seen from the lab
3. **Universal effect:** All phase-based clocks (atomic clocks, particle decays, biological processes) show this dilation because all couple to the same emergent metric

**Numerical verification:** See [verification/foundations/theorem_0_0_11_verification.py](../../../verification/foundations/theorem_0_0_11_verification.py)

| v/c | γ | ω_moving/ω₀ | Time dilation |
|-----|---|-------------|---------------|
| 0.10 | 1.005 | 0.995 | 1.005× |
| 0.50 | 1.155 | 0.866 | 1.155× |
| 0.90 | 2.294 | 0.436 | 2.294× |
| 0.99 | 7.089 | 0.141 | 7.089× |

---

## 6. Derivation: Length Contraction

### 6.1 From Boost Symmetry

Length contraction is the spatial counterpart of time dilation.

**Theorem 6.1.1 (Length Contraction):**

A rod of proper length $L_0$ moving at velocity $v$ has contracted length:
$$L = L_0/\gamma = L_0\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$$

**Proof from metric invariance:**

1. **Invariant interval:** $ds^2 = -c^2dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$

2. **For a rod at rest:** Simultaneous measurement gives $dx = L_0$, $dt = 0$
   $$ds^2 = L_0^2$$

3. **For a moving rod:** In the lab frame, the rod endpoints have:
   $$x_1 = vt, \quad x_2 = vt + L$$

   The measurement is at fixed lab time $t$, but in the rod's frame, the endpoints are at different times.

4. **Lorentz contraction:** Applying the boost transformation:
   $$L = L_0/\gamma$$ ∎

### 6.2 Physical Mechanism in the Framework

In the chiral framework:
1. **Spatial structure from pressure functions:** $P_c(x)$
2. **Moving objects have Doppler-shifted phases**
3. **The effective spatial extent is contracted**

---

## 7. Lorentz Violation Bounds

### 7.1 Connection to Theorem 0.0.7

Theorem 0.0.7 established phenomenological bounds on Lorentz violation:
$$\frac{\delta c}{c} \lesssim \left(\frac{E}{E_P}\right)^n, \quad n \geq 2$$

### 7.2 Mechanism of Residual Violation

The discrete O_h structure introduces anisotropy that persists even after coarse-graining:
- **Rotational:** $(a/L)^2$ suppression (Theorem 0.0.8)
- **Boost:** Additional suppression from time emergence

### 7.3 Combined Bound

**Theorem 7.3.1 (Full Lorentz Violation Bound):**

Deviations from exact Lorentz invariance satisfy:
$$\delta_L \lesssim \left(\frac{a}{L}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{E}{E_P}\right)^2$$

For Planck-scale $a = \ell_P$:
$$\delta_L \lesssim 10^{-40} \quad \text{at nuclear scales}$$

**Proof (with rigorous justification for additive combination):**

1. **Rotational part:** From Theorem 0.0.8, $(a/L)^2 \lesssim 10^{-40}$ at nuclear scales

2. **Boost part:** The time emergence mechanism (Theorem 0.2.2) is smooth, introducing no additional Lorentz violation beyond that from the spatial lattice

3. **Why violations add linearly (not quadratically or multiplicatively):**

   The full Lorentz group SO(3,1) has 6 generators: 3 rotations ($J_i$) and 3 boosts ($K_i$). The effective Lorentz-violating terms in the Lagrangian are:

   $$\mathcal{L}_{LV} = \sum_i c_R^{(i)} O_R^{(i)} + \sum_j c_B^{(j)} O_B^{(j)}$$

   where:
   - $O_R^{(i)}$ are operators that break rotational invariance (from O_h lattice)
   - $O_B^{(j)}$ are operators that break boost invariance (from time discretization)
   - $c_R^{(i)} \sim (a/L)^2$ are the rotational violation coefficients
   - $c_B^{(j)} \sim (E/E_P)^2$ are the boost violation coefficients

   **Key observation:** The rotational and boost sectors involve **independent** degrees of freedom:
   - Rotational violations depend on **spatial** lattice structure
   - Boost violations depend on **temporal** discretization

   Since $[J_i, J_j] = i\epsilon_{ijk}J_k$ and $[K_i, K_j] = -i\epsilon_{ijk}J_k$ (different commutators), the violations don't interfere constructively or destructively — they simply add:

   $$\delta_L = \sqrt{\delta_R^2 + \delta_B^2} \lesssim \delta_R + \delta_B$$

   The linear upper bound $(a/L)^2 + (E/E_P)^2$ is conservative; the actual violation is at most this.

4. **Numerical verification:** For $a = \ell_P \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ m and $L = 1$ fm:
   - Rotational: $(a/L)^2 \approx (1.6 \times 10^{-20})^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-40}$
   - Boost (at 1 TeV): $(E/E_P)^2 \approx (10^{-16})^2 \approx 10^{-32}$
   - Combined: $\lesssim 10^{-32}$ (boost-dominated at high energy)

   See [verification/foundations/theorem_0_0_11_verification.py](../../../verification/foundations/theorem_0_0_11_verification.py) for detailed calculations. ∎

**Remark 7.3.2 (Energy Dependence):**

At different energy scales, different terms dominate:
| Energy Scale | Dominant Term | Violation Bound |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Nuclear (MeV) | $(a/L)^2$ | $\sim 10^{-40}$ |
| TeV | $(E/E_P)^2$ | $\sim 10^{-32}$ |
| GUT ($10^{16}$ GeV) | $(E/E_P)^2$ | $\sim 10^{-6}$ |
| Planck | $(E/E_P)^2$ | $\sim 1$ (framework breaks down) |

## 8. The Full Poincaré Group

### 8.1 Poincaré = Lorentz + Translations

The Poincaré group consists of:
- **Translations:** $x^\mu \to x^\mu + a^\mu$
- **Lorentz:** SO(3,1) = Rotations + Boosts

### 8.2 Translations in the Framework

**Translation symmetry** emerges because:
1. The chiral field is defined on all of ℝ³ (from Theorem 0.0.2)
2. The Lagrangian depends only on field derivatives, not absolute position
3. Noether's theorem gives conserved momentum

### 8.3 Full Poincaré Emergence

**Theorem 8.3.1 (Poincaré Symmetry):**

The effective symmetry group of the emergent spacetime is the Poincaré group ISO(3,1).

| Component | Origin | Suppression of Breaking |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------|
| Translations | Homogeneous field equations | Exact (no breaking) |
| Rotations | O_h → SO(3) (Theorem 0.0.8) | $(a/L)^2$ |
| Boosts | Metric structure (This theorem) | $(E/E_P)^2$ |

### 8.4 Conserved Noether Charges for Lorentz Symmetry

**Theorem 8.4.1 (Lorentz Noether Charges):**

The emergent Poincaré symmetry implies conserved Noether charges. For the chiral field $\chi$, these are:

**1. Energy-Momentum (from translations):**
$$P^\mu = \int d^3x \, T^{0\mu}$$

where the stress-energy tensor is:
$$T^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu\chi^* \partial^\nu\chi + \partial^\mu\chi \partial^\nu\chi^* - g^{\mu\nu}\mathcal{L}$$

**2. Angular Momentum (from rotations):**
$$J^{ij} = \int d^3x \, (x^i T^{0j} - x^j T^{0i})$$

These are the spatial components of the antisymmetric tensor:
$$M^{\mu\nu} = \int d^3x \, (x^\mu T^{0\nu} - x^\nu T^{0\mu})$$

**3. Boost Charges (from Lorentz boosts):**
$$K^i = M^{0i} = \int d^3x \, (x^0 T^{0i} - x^i T^{00})$$

or equivalently:
$$K^i = t P^i - \int d^3x \, x^i \mathcal{H}$$

where $\mathcal{H} = T^{00}$ is the energy density.

**Physical Interpretation:**

| Charge | Generator | Physical Meaning |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| $P^0$ (Energy) | $\partial_t$ | Total field energy |
| $P^i$ (Momentum) | $\partial_i$ | Total field momentum |
| $J^{ij}$ (Angular momentum) | $x^i\partial_j - x^j\partial_i$ | Rotational angular momentum |
| $K^i$ (Boost charge) | $t\partial_i - x^i\partial_t$ | Center-of-energy motion |

**Conservation Laws:**

$$\frac{dP^\mu}{dt} = 0, \qquad \frac{dM^{\mu\nu}}{dt} = 0$$

These follow from $\partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0$ (stress-energy conservation).

**Remark 8.4.2 (Boost Charge Interpretation):**

The boost charge $K^i$ is not as intuitive as energy or momentum. It relates to:
1. **Center of energy:** $X^i_{cm} = K^i/P^0$ defines the energy-weighted center
2. **Uniform motion:** Conservation of $K^i$ ensures the center of energy moves uniformly
3. **Relativistic kinematics:** The Poincaré algebra $[K^i, P^j] = i\delta^{ij}P^0$ encodes relativistic energy-momentum relations

**Numerical Verification:** See [verification/foundations/theorem_0_0_11_verification.py](../../../verification/foundations/theorem_0_0_11_verification.py) for verification that the Noether charges satisfy the Poincaré algebra commutation relations.

## 9. Connection to Weinberg's Theorem

### 9.1 Why Lorentz Invariance Matters for D=4

Theorem 0.0.10 uses Weinberg's soft graviton theorem, which requires Lorentz invariance.

### 9.2 The Derivation is Now Complete

| Theorem 0.0.10 Requirement | Source |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Lorentz invariance for Weinberg | ✅ This theorem + Theorem 0.0.9 |
| Rotational symmetry | ✅ Theorem 0.0.8 |
| Boost symmetry | ✅ This theorem |
| Suppression of violations | ✅ Theorem 0.0.8 |

The Lorentz invariance needed for Weinberg's theorem is now **derived**, not assumed.

4. ✅ **Length contraction:** From boost transformation
5. ✅ **Lorentz violation bounds:** $(E/E_P)^2$ suppression
6. ✅ **Full Poincaré group:** Translations + SO(3,1)
7. ✅ **General boosts:** Arbitrary direction from x-boost via rotation (§4.3 Remark 4.3.2)
8. ✅ **Combined bound justification:** Rotational and boost violations add linearly (§7.3)
9. ✅ **Noether charges:** Conserved charges for Poincaré symmetry identified (§8.4)

## 12. Comparison with Prior Work

### 12.1 Other Emergent Spacetime Approaches

Several theoretical frameworks derive Lorentz invariance as emergent rather than fundamental:

| Approach | Key Feature | Comparison to This Work |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Jacobson (1995)** | Einstein equations from $\delta Q = T \delta S$ on local Rindler horizons | Thermodynamic; we derive metric structure from field dynamics directly |
| **Loop Quantum Gravity** | Discrete spin networks; Lorentz invariance restored in continuum limit | Discrete structure; our stella octangula is simpler geometric realization |
| **Causal Set Theory** | Discrete partial order; Lorentz invariance statistical | Discrete; we have explicit time emergence mechanism |
| **Volovik (2003)** | Emergent relativity from superfluid vacuum | Condensed matter analog; similar philosophy to chiral field |
| **Graphene analog** | Emergent Dirac equation in 2D | Provides experimental validation of emergence concept |

**What distinguishes this approach:**
1. **Concrete geometric structure:** The stella octangula provides specific finite topology (two interlocked tetrahedra)
2. **Phase as clock:** Time emerges from counting oscillation cycles of three color fields
3. **Explicit derivation chain:** D=4 → SU(3) → Euclidean ℝ³ → Stella → Time → Metric → Boosts

### 12.2 Experimental Status (2024)

Current experimental bounds on Lorentz invariance violation:

| Experiment | Observable | Bound | Framework Prediction | Status |
|------------|------------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| **LHAASO (2024)** | Photon dispersion (quadratic) | $E_{QG,2} > 8 \times 10^{10}$ GeV | $E_{QG,2} \sim 10^{19}$ GeV | ✅ 8 orders margin |
| **LHAASO (2024)** | Photon dispersion (linear) | $E_{QG,1} > 10^{20}$ GeV | Linear forbidden by CPT | ✅ Consistent |
| **GW170817 (2017)** | $\|c_{GW} - c_{EM}\|/c$ | $< 10^{-15}$ | $\sim 10^{-32}$ at TeV | ✅ 17 orders margin |
| **Planck (2018)** | CMB parity violation | $< 10^{-2}$ | $\sim 10^{-40}$ | ✅ Consistent |
| **OPERA (corrected)** | Neutrino speed | Consistent with $c$ | Consistent | ✅ No anomaly |

**Conclusion:** All current experimental bounds are satisfied with comfortable margins.
