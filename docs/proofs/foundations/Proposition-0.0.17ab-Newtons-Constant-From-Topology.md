## §1. Formal Statement

**Proposition 0.0.17ab (Newton's Constant from Pre-Geometric Principles).**
*Given the single dimensional input $R_{\text{stella}} = 0.44847$ fm (the characteristic radius of the stella octangula, determined from observed QCD string tension) and the topological constants $(N_c = 3, N_f = 3, \chi = 4)$ derived from the stella octangula boundary $\partial\mathcal{S}$, Newton's gravitational constant is:*

$$\boxed{G = \frac{\hbar c}{8\pi f_\chi^2}}$$

*where the chiral decay constant $f_\chi$ is determined without circular reference to $G$ via the chain:*

$$f_\chi = \frac{M_P}{\sqrt{8\pi}}, \qquad M_P = \frac{\sqrt{\chi}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\sigma} \cdot \exp\!\left(\frac{1}{2b_0 \alpha_s(M_P)}\right) \cdot \mathcal{C}_{\text{NP}}$$

*with $\sqrt{\sigma} = \hbar c / R_{\text{stella}}$, $b_0 = 9/(4\pi)$, $\alpha_s(M_P) = 1/64$, and $\mathcal{C}_{\text{NP}}$ the non-perturbative correction factor from Proposition 0.0.17z.*

*This yields $G \approx 6.52 \times 10^{-11}\;\text{m}^3/(\text{kg}\cdot\text{s}^2)$, within 2.3% of the CODATA value $G_{\text{obs}} = 6.67430(15) \times 10^{-11}\;\text{m}^3/(\text{kg}\cdot\text{s}^2)$, well inside the $\pm 14\%$ theoretical uncertainty budget.*

## §3. Dependency DAG

The derivation chain is a directed acyclic graph with **no circular dependency on $G$**:

```
TOPOLOGICAL INPUTS (no free parameters)
├── Def 0.1.1: ∂S = ∂T₊ ⊔ ∂T₋ → χ = 4
├── Thm 0.0.3: SU(3) from stella → N_c = 3
├── Prop 0.0.17t: b₀ = (11N_c − 2N_f)/(12π) = 9/(4π)
└── Prop 0.0.17w: 1/α_s(M_P) = (N_c² − 1)² = 64

DERIVATION CHAIN
Step 1: √σ = ℏc/R_stella = 440 MeV                    [Prop 0.0.17j]
Step 2: M_P^(1-loop) = (√χ/2)·√σ·exp(1/(2b₀α_s))     [Thm 5.2.6]
        = 1 × 440 MeV × exp(128π/9)
        = 1.12 × 10¹⁹ GeV
Step 3: M_P^(corrected) = M_P^(1-loop) / C_NP          [Prop 0.0.17z]
        where C_NP accounts for:
        − Gluon condensate (−3%)
        − Threshold matching (−3%)
        − Higher-order perturbative (−2%)
        − Instanton effects (−1.6%)
        Total: −9.6% ± 2%
Step 4: f_χ = M_P/√(8π)                                [Prop 5.2.4a]
        (Sakharov induced gravity identification)
Step 5: G = ℏc/(8πf_χ²) = ℏc/M_P²                     [Thm 5.2.4]

OUTPUT: G derived. No G was used as input at any step.
```

**Critical point:** Step 4 uses the Sakharov induced gravity mechanism (Prop 5.2.4a), which derives $f_\chi = M_P/\sqrt{8\pi}$ from the one-loop effective action of the chiral field — **not** from matching to observed $G$. This closes the gap explicitly acknowledged in Theorem 5.2.4 §1.

## §4. Honesty Table: What Is Derived vs. What Is Input

| Aspect | Status | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Formula $G = 1/(8\pi f_\chi^2)$ | ✅ DERIVED | Theorem 5.2.4 (scalar-tensor correspondence) |
| $f_\chi = M_P/\sqrt{8\pi}$ | ✅ DERIVED | Prop 5.2.4a (Sakharov induced gravity, no G input) |
| $M_P$ from dimensional transmutation | ✅ DERIVED | Theorem 5.2.6 (topology + QCD running) |
| Non-perturbative corrections | ✅ DERIVED | Prop 0.0.17z (standard QCD physics) |
| Geometric corrections (z1, z2) | ✅ DERIVED | Props 0.0.17z1, z2 (stella geometry) |
| $b_0 = 9/(4\pi)$ | ✅ DERIVED | Prop 0.0.17t (index theorem on stella) |
| $1/\alpha_s(M_P) = 64$ | 🔶 PREDICTED | Prop 0.0.17w (equipartition on stella) |
| $R_{\text{stella}} = 0.44847$ fm | **INPUT** | Single dimensional parameter (observed QCD scale) |

**What this proposition IS:** A derivation of $G$ from $R_{\text{stella}}$ (the QCD confinement scale) using only topology and standard QCD. This closes the gap identified in Theorem 5.2.4 §1, where $f_\chi$ was "determined from $G$."

**What this proposition is NOT:** A prediction of $G$ from zero dimensional inputs. Any physical theory requires one dimensional quantity to set units. Here, $R_{\text{stella}}$ serves that role.

**The physical content:** Given the QCD confinement scale, the framework predicts the gravitational scale via dimensional transmutation — a hierarchy of $\sim 10^{19}$ arising purely from topology.

**Constraining power (honesty statement):** This proposition assembles results from Props 0.0.17w ($1/\alpha_s = 64$) and 5.2.4a ($N_{\text{eff}} = 96\pi^2$), each derived independently in their own propositions. Within this document, they appear as inputs. A skeptical reading would note that three quantities ($R_{\text{stella}}$, $1/\alpha_s$, $N_{\text{eff}}$) determine one observable ($M_P$), making this a consistency check rather than a strong prediction. The constraining power comes from the *independent* derivations of $1/\alpha_s$ and $N_{\text{eff}}$ — neither was fitted to reproduce $G$. The framework's predictive strength is tested by the full set of downstream observables ($f_\pi$, $T_c/\sqrt{\sigma}$, fermion mass ratios), not by $G$ alone.

## §5. Agreement with Observation

### §5.1. Leading-Order Result (One-Loop)

Using the one-loop formula (Theorem 5.2.6):

$$M_P^{(1)} = \frac{\sqrt{4}}{2} \times 440\;\text{MeV} \times \exp\!\left(\frac{128\pi}{9}\right) = 1.12 \times 10^{19}\;\text{GeV}$$

This gives 91.5% of the observed $M_P = 1.221 \times 10^{19}$ GeV.

### §5.2. Corrected Result

After non-perturbative corrections (Prop 0.0.17z):

$$\sqrt{\sigma}_{\text{corrected}} = 481.1 \times (1 - 0.096) = 434.6 \pm 10\;\text{MeV}$$

**Agreement:** $|434.6 - 440| / \sqrt{10^2 + 30^2} = 0.17\sigma$ with FLAG 2024 lattice value.

After scale-dependent $\chi_{\text{eff}}$ correction (Prop 0.0.17z2):

$$\sqrt{\sigma}_{\text{z2}} = 439.2 \pm 7\;\text{MeV}$$

**Agreement:** $0.02\sigma$ — essentially exact.

### §5.3. Implied G

From $M_P$ and $G = \hbar c / M_P^2$:

| Quantity | Predicted | Observed (CODATA 2018) | Agreement |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|-----------|
| $M_P$ (1-loop) | $1.12 \times 10^{19}$ GeV | $1.221 \times 10^{19}$ GeV | 91.5% |
| $M_P$ (corrected) | $1.235 \times 10^{19}$ GeV | $1.221 \times 10^{19}$ GeV | $+1.2\%$ |
| $G$ (corrected) | $6.52 \times 10^{-11}$ | $6.67430(15) \times 10^{-11}$ | $-2.3\%$ |

## §6. Significance: Closing the Pre-Geometric Gap

This proposition resolves the last open item identified in the "What remains to be done" analysis of Prop 0.0.17z:

> *"Derive G from pre-geometric principles — currently $G = 1/(8\pi f_\chi^2)$ is a self-consistency relation, but deriving $f_\chi$ without reference to the Planck scale would make the chain fully closed."*

The resolution: $f_\chi$ is NOT derived "without reference to the Planck scale." Instead, $M_P$ (and hence $f_\chi = M_P/\sqrt{8\pi}$) is **derived from $R_{\text{stella}}$** via dimensional transmutation (Theorem 5.2.6). The Sakharov mechanism (Prop 5.2.4a) then gives $G = 1/(8\pi f_\chi^2)$ as a *consequence*, not an input.

The framework now has **exactly one free dimensional parameter**: $R_{\text{stella}}$.
