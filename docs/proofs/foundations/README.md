# Phase -1: Pre-Geometric Foundations

This phase derives the foundational inputs (spacetime dimension, Euclidean metric, stella octangula) from a single irreducible axiom: "Observers can exist."

## Key Results

- D = 4 is the unique spacetime dimension permitting complex observers
- The Euclidean metric on R^3 is uniquely determined by the Killing form of SU(3)
- The stella octangula is the unique minimal 3D geometric realization of SU(3)
- Axioms A0 and A1 are unified into A0' (information metric) via Theorem 0.0.17
- **Axiom A5 (Born rule) is derived** from geodesic flow ergodicity (Proposition 0.0.17a)
- **Axiom A0' (information metric) is derived** from Chentsov uniqueness (Proposition 0.0.17b)
- **Axiom A6 (square-integrability) is derived** from pre-geometric energy (Proposition 0.0.17e)
- **Irreducible axiom count:** 1 (A7 only — measurement as decoherence)
