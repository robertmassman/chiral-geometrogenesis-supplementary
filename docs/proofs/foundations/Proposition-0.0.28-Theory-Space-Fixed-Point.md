# Proposition 0.0.28: Theory Space and Self-Consistency Fixed Point

## Status: 🔶 NOVEL — Categorical formalization of self-consistency

**Created:** 2026-02-05
**Purpose:** Define "theory space" T rigorously as a category of physical theories and prove that Chiral Geometrogenesis (CG) is a fixed point of the self-consistency map Φ: T → T, establishing that self-consistent physical theories emerge as fixed points of their own predictions.

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ [Proposition 0.0.17y](Proposition-0.0.17y-Bootstrap-Fixed-Point-Uniqueness.md) — Bootstrap fixed-point uniqueness (7 equations, DAG structure)
- ✅ [Theorem 0.0.19](Theorem-0.0.19-Quantitative-Self-Reference-Uniqueness.md) — Quantitative vs logical self-reference distinction
- ✅ [Research-D3-Category-Theoretic-Formalization.md](Research-D3-Category-Theoretic-Formalization.md) — Lawvere structure of bootstrap
- 🔶 [Theorem 0.0.29](Theorem-0.0.29-Lawvere-Bootstrap-Uniqueness.md) — Lawvere + DAG → uniqueness (derived from this)

**Enables:**
- Rigorous foundation for "self-consistency as mathematical primitive" (Path B)
- Wheeler's "It from Bit" made precise in categorical language
- Framework for comparing CG to other physical theories

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Main Result

**Proposition 0.0.28 (Theory Space Fixed Point)**

> Let **T** be the category of physical theories with objects (C, D, O, Σ) and morphisms preserving observables. Define the self-consistency map Φ: T → T by Φ(T) = "predictions of T about T's own scales."
>
> Then:
> 1. **(Existence)** Chiral Geometrogenesis is a fixed point: Φ(CG) = CG
> 2. **(Uniqueness under constraints)** Under physical constraints (causality, unitarity, Lorentz invariance, holographic bound), CG is the unique fixed point with topological input (N_c, N_f, |Z₃|) = (3, 3, 3)

### 1.2 Physical Significance

The theorem elevates the bootstrap self-consistency from a numerical observation ("the equations have a unique solution") to a categorical necessity ("self-consistent theories ARE fixed points of self-prediction"). This realizes Wheeler's "It from Bit" vision: physical reality ("It") emerges as the fixed point of information-theoretic self-consistency conditions ("Bit").

### 1.3 Key Insight

The self-consistency map Φ acts on the space of theories, not the space of observables. This is a crucial distinction:
- **Prop 0.0.17y**: Fixed point in observable space (ℝ⁷₊)
- **This proposition**: Fixed point in theory space (**T**)

The relationship: CG's observable fixed point is the *image* of the theory-space fixed point under the "observable extraction" functor.

### 2.1 Symbol Table

| Symbol | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| **T** | Category | Theory space (category of physical theories) |
| T = (C, D, O, Σ) | Object of **T** | A physical theory with components |
| C | Space | Configuration space |
| D | Structure | Dynamics (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian) |
| O | Space | Observable space |

| ι: T₁ ↪ T₂ | Morphism | Theory embedding (preserves observables) |
| η: Obs^Enc | Object | Exponential object (encoding morphisms) |
| **Phys** | Category | Physical configurations (from Research-D3) |

### 2.2 Preliminary: Category Phys (Recap from Research-D3)

From [Research-D3-Category-Theoretic-Formalization.md](Research-D3-Category-Theoretic-Formalization.md), we have the category **Phys** of physical configurations:

**Definition 2.2.1 (Category Phys):**
- **Objects:**
  - **Obs** = ℝ⁷₊ (seven positive reals: R_stella, ℓ_P, √σ, M_P, a, α_s, b₀)
  - **Enc** = {holographic boundary configurations of stella}
  - **Obs^Enc** = Maps from configurations to observables
- **Morphisms:** Smooth maps respecting dimensional structure
- **Structure:** Cartesian closed (products, exponentials exist)

**Phys** is the "internal" category where bootstrap equations live. **T** is the "external" category where theories themselves are objects.

## 3. Theory Space: Definition and Structure

### 3.0 Scope and Membership of T

**Definition 3.0.1 (Scope of Theory Space):**

The category **T** contains all theories that can be formulated as tuples T = (C, D, O, Σ). This includes:

| Theory Type | In **T**? | Configuration Space C | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Quantum field theories | ✅ | Field configurations on spacetime | Standard QFT framework |
| Pre-geometric theories | ✅ | Configurations on pre-geometric arena | CG, causal sets, spin foams |
| Classical field theories | ✅ | Field configurations on manifold | GR, electromagnetism |
| String/M-theory vacua | ✅ | String/brane configurations | Each vacuum is a separate object |
| Lattice gauge theories | ✅ | Gauge links on lattice | Discrete C, continuous O |
| Effective field theories | ✅ | Low-energy field modes | With explicit cutoff in Σ |
| Pure mathematics | ❌ | N/A | No physical observable space O |

**Key design choice:** **T** is defined broadly to include all candidate physical theories, not just those already known to be self-consistent. The subcategory **T**_phys (§7.1) imposes physical viability constraints.

**On the category size:**

**T** is a *large* category in the set-theoretic sense:
- Objects are proper classes (configuration spaces can have cardinality ≥ continuum)
- This is analogous to the category **Set** or **Top** being large
- For practical purposes, we work with the subcategory **T**_phys which may be "essentially small" if physical constraints restrict to countably many viable theories (an open question)

**No Russell-type paradox:** The self-consistency map Φ: **T** → **T** is well-defined because it acts on *objects* (theories), not on the category itself. There is no "theory of all theories" paradox because Φ(T) is another object in **T**, not a statement about **T**.

### 3.1 Definition of a Physical Theory Object

**Definition 3.1.1 (Physical Theory):**

A *physical theory* is a tuple T = (C, D, O, Σ) where:

1. **Configuration Space C:**
   - A topological space representing possible physical configurations
   - Equipped with appropriate structure (manifold, measure space, etc.)
   - Example (CG): C = {stella boundary configurations} × {gauge fields on ∂S}

2. **Dynamics D:**
   - A specification of time evolution and/or constraints
   - Typically: Lagrangian L: TC → ℝ, Hamiltonian H: T*C → ℝ, or action functional S[φ]
   - Example (CG): D = pre-geometric energy functional E[χ] + bootstrap equations

3. **Observable Space O:**
   - A space of measurable quantities extractable from the theory
   - Equipped with metric structure for comparing predictions
   - Example (CG): O = ℝ⁷₊ (dimensionless ratios: ξ, η, ζ, α_s, b₀, plus ℓ_P, M_P for units)

4. **Constraint Set Σ:**
   - Discrete topological/group-theoretic constraints
   - Consistency conditions the theory must satisfy
   - Example (CG): Σ = {N_c = 3, N_f = 3, |Z₃| = 3, χ = 4}

**Notation:** We write T = (C_T, D_T, O_T, Σ_T) when the theory needs to be specified.

### 3.2 Morphisms in Theory Space

**Definition 3.2.1 (Theory Embedding):**

A *theory embedding* ι: T₁ → T₂ between physical theories T₁ = (C₁, D₁, O₁, Σ₁) and T₂ = (C₂, D₂, O₂, Σ₂) is a quadruple ι = (ι_C, ι_D, ι_O, ι_Σ) where:

1. **Configuration embedding:** ι_C: C₁ ↪ C₂ is a topological embedding
2. **Dynamics compatibility:** D₂|_{ι_C(C₁)} = ι_D(D₁) (restricting T₂ to the embedded configurations recovers T₁ dynamics)
3. **Observable preservation:** ι_O: O₁ ↪ O₂ preserves metric structure
4. **Constraint inheritance:** ι_Σ: Σ₁ → Σ₂ such that satisfying Σ₂ implies satisfying Σ₁

**Definition 3.2.2 (Theory Isomorphism):**

A theory isomorphism T₁ ≅ T₂ is a theory embedding ι: T₁ → T₂ with an inverse embedding ι⁻¹: T₂ → T₁.

### 3.3 The Category **T** (Theory Space)

**Definition 3.3.1 (Theory Space Category T):**

The *theory space* **T** is the category where:
- **Objects:** Physical theories T = (C, D, O, Σ) as defined above
- **Morphisms:** Theory embeddings ι: T₁ → T₂
- **Identity:** The identity embedding id_T = (id_C, id_D, id_O, id_Σ)
- **Composition:** (ι₂ ∘ ι₁)_X = ι₂,X ∘ ι₁,X for each component X ∈ {C, D, O, Σ}

**Verification of Category Axioms:**
1. **Associativity:** (ι₃ ∘ ι₂) ∘ ι₁ = ι₃ ∘ (ι₂ ∘ ι₁) — follows from associativity in Set/Top
2. **Identity:** id_T ∘ ι = ι = ι ∘ id_T — follows from identity properties
3. **Composition well-defined:** If ι₁: T₁ → T₂ and ι₂: T₂ → T₃, then ι₂ ∘ ι₁: T₁ → T₃ — by composition of embeddings

---

## 4. The Self-Consistency Map Φ

### 4.1 Intuition

The self-consistency map Φ captures the idea that a theory makes predictions about its own fundamental scales. For CG:
- CG predicts the QCD scale √σ from topological constants
- CG predicts the Planck scale ℓ_P from holographic self-encoding
- These predictions must match the inputs for the theory to be self-consistent

**Self-consistency condition:** Φ(T) = T means "the theory's predictions about itself match its own structure."

### 4.2 Formal Definition

**Definition 4.2.1 (Observable Extraction Functor):**

Define the *observable extraction functor* Obs: **T** → **Phys** by:
- On objects: Obs(T) = O_T (the observable space of theory T)
- On morphisms: Obs(ι) = ι_O (the observable component of the embedding)

This is a functor because it preserves composition and identity.

**Definition 4.2.2 (Prediction Map):**

For a theory T = (C, D, O, Σ), define the *prediction map* P_T: Σ → O by:
- P_T(σ) = "observables predicted by T given constraints σ"

For CG, this is the bootstrap map:
$$P_{CG}(N_c, N_f, |Z_3|) = (\xi, \eta, \zeta, \alpha_s, b_0)$$
where ξ = exp(128π/9), etc.

**Definition 4.2.3 (Self-Consistency Map Φ):**

The *self-consistency map* Φ: **T** → **T** is defined on objects by:

$$\Phi(T) = (C_T, D_T', O_T', \Sigma_T)$$

where:
- $O_T'$ = P_T(Σ_T) = observables predicted by T from its constraints
- $D_T'$ = dynamics parametrized by predicted observables (defined below)

**Definition (D'_T — Modified Dynamics):**

Given theory T = (C_T, D_T, O_T, Σ_T), the *modified dynamics* D'_T is constructed as follows:

1. **Observable-Dependent Dynamics:** Every physical theory has dynamics that implicitly or explicitly depend on certain observable parameters. Write D_T = D_T(o) where o ∈ O_T denotes these observables.

2. **Self-Consistent Parametrization:** D'_T is D_T evaluated at the predicted observables:
   $$D'_T := D_T(P_T(\Sigma_T))$$

3. **For CG explicitly:** If D_CG contains the action functional S[φ; √σ, ℓ_P, ...] depending on physical scales, then:
   $$D'_{CG} = S[\phi; \sqrt{\sigma}_{\text{pred}}, \ell_{P,\text{pred}}, ...] = S[\phi; P_{CG}(\Sigma_{CG})]$$
   where the predicted values come from the bootstrap equations.

**Physical Interpretation:** D'_T is "the dynamics T would have if its assumed observables matched its predictions." For a self-consistent theory, D'_T = D_T because the theory already assumes the correct values.

**Clarification:** Φ takes a theory T, computes what T predicts about its own observables, and returns a theory with those predicted observables as its observable space and dynamics parametrized by those predicted values.

**On morphisms:** For a theory embedding ι: T₁ → T₂ with components (ι_C, ι_D, ι_O, ι_Σ), define:
$$\Phi(\iota) = (\iota_C, \iota'_D, \iota'_O, \iota_\Sigma): \Phi(T_1) \to \Phi(T_2)$$
where:
- ι'_D restricts D'_{T₂} to the embedded configurations, yielding D'_{T₁}
- ι'_O = P_{T₂} ∘ ι_Σ: maps predicted observables of T₁ into those of T₂

### 4.2.4 Proof of Functoriality

**Proposition 4.2.4 (Φ is a Functor):**

> The self-consistency map Φ: **T** → **T** is an endofunctor, i.e., it preserves identities and composition.

**Proof:**

**(1) Identity Preservation: Φ(id_T) = id_{Φ(T)}**

Let T = (C, D, O, Σ) be a theory object. The identity morphism is:
$$\text{id}_T = (\text{id}_C, \text{id}_D, \text{id}_O, \text{id}_\Sigma)$$

Applying Φ:
$$\Phi(\text{id}_T) = (\text{id}_C, \text{id}'_D, \text{id}'_O, \text{id}_\Sigma)$$

Now observe:
- id'_D: D'_T → D'_T is the identity because restricting D'_T to all of C yields D'_T
- id'_O = P_T ∘ id_Σ = P_T: O'_T → O'_T, but since O'_T = P_T(Σ), this acts as identity on O'_T

Therefore Φ(id_T) = (id_C, id_{D'}, id_{O'}, id_Σ) = id_{Φ(T)}. ✓

**(2) Composition Preservation: Φ(ι₂ ∘ ι₁) = Φ(ι₂) ∘ Φ(ι₁)**

Let ι₁: T₁ → T₂ and ι₂: T₂ → T₃ be theory embeddings. We have:
$$\iota_2 \circ \iota_1 = (\iota_{2,C} \circ \iota_{1,C}, \iota_{2,D} \circ \iota_{1,D}, \iota_{2,O} \circ \iota_{1,O}, \iota_{2,\Sigma} \circ \iota_{1,\Sigma})$$

**Compute Φ(ι₂ ∘ ι₁):**
$$\Phi(\iota_2 \circ \iota_1) = (\iota_{2,C} \circ \iota_{1,C}, (\iota_{2,D} \circ \iota_{1,D})', (\iota_{2,O} \circ \iota_{1,O})', \iota_{2,\Sigma} \circ \iota_{1,\Sigma})$$

**Compute Φ(ι₂) ∘ Φ(ι₁):**

$\Phi(\iota_1) = (\iota_{1,C}, \iota'_{1,D}, \iota'_{1,O}, \iota_{1,\Sigma})$

$\Phi(\iota_2) = (\iota_{2,C}, \iota'_{2,D}, \iota'_{2,O}, \iota_{2,\Sigma})$

Composing:
$$\Phi(\iota_2) \circ \Phi(\iota_1) = (\iota_{2,C} \circ \iota_{1,C}, \iota'_{2,D} \circ \iota'_{1,D}, \iota'_{2,O} \circ \iota'_{1,O}, \iota_{2,\Sigma} \circ \iota_{1,\Sigma})$$

**Verify component equality:**

- C-component: Both give ι_{2,C} ∘ ι_{1,C} ✓
- Σ-component: Both give ι_{2,Σ} ∘ ι_{1,Σ} ✓
- D'-component: (ι₂ ∘ ι₁)'_D = ι'_{2,D} ∘ ι'_{1,D} because dynamics restriction composes ✓
- O'-component: The observable map factors through the prediction maps:
  $$(\iota_{2,O} \circ \iota_{1,O})' = P_{T_3} \circ \iota_{2,\Sigma} \circ \iota_{1,\Sigma} = (P_{T_3} \circ \iota_{2,\Sigma}) \circ \iota_{1,\Sigma} = \iota'_{2,O} \circ \iota'_{1,O}$$

Therefore Φ(ι₂ ∘ ι₁) = Φ(ι₂) ∘ Φ(ι₁). ✓

**Conclusion:** Φ is a well-defined endofunctor on **T**. □

### 4.3 Fixed Point Condition

**Definition 4.3.1 (Fixed Point of Φ):**

A theory T is a *fixed point* of Φ if Φ(T) ≅ T (isomorphic as objects in **T**).

**Explicitly:** T is a fixed point iff O_T = P_T(Σ_T) — the observables in the theory match its own predictions.

## 5. Chiral Geometrogenesis as Theory Object

### 5.1 CG Components

**Definition 5.1.1 (Chiral Geometrogenesis Theory):**

CG = (C_CG, D_CG, O_CG, Σ_CG) where:

1. **Configuration Space C_CG:**
   $$C_{CG} = \{(\chi_R, \chi_G, \chi_B) : \partial\mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{C}^3 \mid \text{color constraints satisfied}\}$$
   - Three chiral fields on stella boundary ∂S
   - Subject to SU(3) gauge equivalence
   - Holographic encoding: I_stella = I_gravity

2. **Dynamics D_CG:**
   $$D_{CG} = \{E[\chi], \text{ bootstrap equations } \mathcal{E}_1, ..., \mathcal{E}_7\}$$
   - Pre-geometric energy functional E[χ] (Theorem 0.2.4)
   - Seven bootstrap equations (Prop 0.0.17y)

3. **Observable Space O_CG:**
   $$O_{CG} = \mathbb{R}^5_+ = \{(\xi, \eta, \zeta, \alpha_s, b_0) \mid \xi, \eta, \zeta, \alpha_s, b_0 > 0\}$$
   - Dimensionless ratios (ξ = R_stella/ℓ_P, etc.)
   - Plus choice of units (ℓ_P or M_P)

4. **Constraint Set Σ_CG:**
   $$\Sigma_{CG} = \{(N_c, N_f, |Z_3|) = (3, 3, 3), \chi(\partial\mathcal{S}) = 4\}$$
   - Topological constants from stella geometry
   - Euler characteristic χ = 4 (two spheres S²)

### 5.2 CG Prediction Map

**Proposition 5.2.1 (CG Prediction Map):**

The prediction map P_CG: Σ_CG → O_CG is given by the bootstrap equations:

$$P_{CG}(3, 3, 3) = \left(\exp\left(\frac{128\pi}{9}\right), \sqrt{\frac{8\ln 3}{\sqrt{3}}}, \exp\left(-\frac{128\pi}{9}\right), \frac{1}{64}, \frac{9}{4\pi}\right)$$

**Proof:**
From Proposition 0.0.17y, the bootstrap equations are:
- $\xi = \exp((N_c^2 - 1)^2 / (2b_0))$ where $b_0 = (11N_c - 2N_f)/(12\pi)$
- For $(N_c, N_f) = (3, 3)$: $b_0 = 27/(12\pi) = 9/(4\pi)$
- $\xi = \exp(64 / (2 \cdot 9/(4\pi))) = \exp(64 \cdot 4\pi / 18) = \exp(128\pi/9)$
- $\eta = \sqrt{8\ln|Z_3|/\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{8\ln 3/\sqrt{3}}$ (from holographic bound)
- $\zeta = 1/\xi = \exp(-128\pi/9)$
- $\alpha_s = 1/(N_c^2 - 1)^2 = 1/64$
- $b_0 = 9/(4\pi) \approx 0.7162$

These are computed purely from Σ_CG = (3, 3, 3). □

## 6. Main Theorem: CG is a Fixed Point

### 6.1 Statement

**Proposition 0.0.28 (CG is Fixed Point of Φ):**

> Chiral Geometrogenesis is a fixed point of the self-consistency map:
> $$\Phi(CG) = CG$$

### 6.2 Proof

**Proof:**

We must show that Φ(CG) ≅ CG, i.e., the predicted observables match the theory's observables.

**Step 1: Compute Φ(CG)**

By Definition 4.2.3:
$$\Phi(CG) = (C_{CG}, D'_{CG}, O'_{CG}, \Sigma_{CG})$$
where $O'_{CG} = P_{CG}(\Sigma_{CG})$.

**Step 2: Compute P_CG(Σ_CG)**

From Proposition 5.2.1:
$$P_{CG}(3, 3, 3) = \left(\exp\left(\frac{128\pi}{9}\right), \sqrt{\frac{8\ln 3}{\sqrt{3}}}, \exp\left(-\frac{128\pi}{9}\right), \frac{1}{64}, \frac{9}{4\pi}\right)$$

**Step 3: Compare with O_CG**

The observable space O_CG is defined as ℝ⁵₊ parameterized by (ξ, η, ζ, α_s, b₀).

**Key observation:** In CG, the observables are not arbitrary points in ℝ⁵₊ but the specific values determined by the bootstrap:
$$O_{CG}^{\text{actual}} = P_{CG}(\Sigma_{CG})$$

This is the content of Proposition 0.0.17y: the bootstrap equations have a unique solution, and CG IS that solution.

**Step 4: Verify isomorphism**

We need Φ(CG) ≅ CG. The components:
- C_CG unchanged ✓
- Σ_CG unchanged ✓
- O'_CG = P_CG(Σ_CG) = O_CG^actual ✓
- D'_CG is compatible with O_CG^actual ✓

Therefore Φ(CG) = CG (not just isomorphic, but equal). □

### 6.3 Interpretation and Definitional Nature

**Acknowledging the definitional aspect:**

The fixed-point result Φ(CG) = CG is partly definitional. CG is *constructed* to satisfy the bootstrap equations (Prop 0.0.17y), which means O_CG is *defined* as the solution to those equations. In this sense, the fixed-point property is immediate once CG is defined.

**What is NOT definitional:**

1. **Existence:** The bootstrap equations could have had no solution, or multiple solutions. Prop 0.0.17y proves they have exactly one solution (up to scale).

2. **Physicality:** The resulting values (√σ ≈ 440 MeV, etc.) agree with observation. This was not guaranteed—the bootstrap could have predicted values wildly incompatible with reality.

3. **Uniqueness:** Among all theories in **T**_phys with stella geometry, CG is the unique fixed point. This is non-trivial and follows from the DAG structure.

**The non-trivial content:**

The proposition's real content is not "CG satisfies its own equations" (which is definitional) but rather:
- **That such a self-consistent theory exists at all**
- **That it is unique under physical constraints**
- **That its predictions match observation**

The fixed-point formalism provides the *language* to express this; the physics content comes from the bootstrap equations themselves.

**Analogy:** The Euler-Lagrange equations define a stationary point of the action. Saying "the classical path is a stationary point" is partly definitional. But the non-trivial content is that such paths exist, are unique under boundary conditions, and match observed motion.

The proof shows that CG is a fixed point because:
1. CG's observables ARE its predictions (by definition/construction)
2. The bootstrap equations ensure self-consistency
3. There is no gap between what CG predicts and what CG assumes

**Wheeler's "It from Bit" realized:**
- "Bit" = topological constraints Σ_CG = (3, 3, 3)
- "It" = physical observables O_CG
- Emergence = fixed point condition Φ(CG) = CG

---

## 7. Uniqueness Analysis

### 7.1 Physical Constraints on T

Not every object in **T** is a physically viable theory. We impose:

**Definition 7.1.1 (Physical Constraints):**

A theory T ∈ **T** is *physically viable* if it satisfies:

1. **Causality:** Information propagation respects light cones
2. **Unitarity:** Probability is conserved (S-matrix unitary)
3. **Emergent Lorentz invariance:** Effective spacetime respects special relativity at scales L ≫ ℓ_P
4. **Holographic bound:** Information capacity ≤ A/(4ℓ_P²) for any region
5. **Asymptotic freedom:** UV coupling → 0 (for non-Abelian gauge theories)

Let **T**_phys ⊂ **T** denote the subcategory of physically viable theories.

**Clarification on Lorentz Invariance (Constraint 3):**

The constraint is *emergent*, not assumed. For theories in **T**_phys that derive spacetime from pre-geometric structure:

- **What is NOT assumed:** Fundamental Lorentz symmetry as an axiom
- **What IS required:** That the emergent effective spacetime exhibits Lorentz invariance to measurable precision

**For CG specifically:**
- The underlying structure (stella octangula, FCC lattice) has only discrete O_h symmetry (48 elements)
- Continuous SO(3,1) Lorentz symmetry emerges in the infrared limit via coarse-graining
- Deviations from exact Lorentz invariance are suppressed by (a/L)² where a ~ ℓ_P
- At physical observation scales, this suppression is ≲ 10⁻⁴⁰ — utterly unobservable

**Established by:**
- [Theorem 0.0.8 (Emergent Rotational Symmetry)](Theorem-0.0.8-Emergent-Rotational-Symmetry.md) — O_h → effective SO(3) via coarse-graining
- [Theorem 0.0.7 (Lorentz Violation Bounds)](Theorem-0.0.7-Lorentz-Violation-Bounds.md) — Quantitative bounds on violations
- [Theorem 5.2.1 (Emergent Metric)](../Phase5/Theorem-5.2.1-Emergent-Metric.md) — Metric emergence from chiral correlations

**Formal statement:** A pre-geometric theory T satisfies "emergent Lorentz invariance" if for all observables O at scale L:
$$|\mathcal{O}[g \cdot \phi] - \mathcal{O}[\phi]| \lesssim \left(\frac{\ell_P}{L}\right)^2 \cdot |\mathcal{O}[\phi]|$$
for all Lorentz transformations g ∈ SO(3,1). The fixed-point CG satisfies this bound.

### 7.2 Uniqueness under Constraints

**Conjecture 7.2.1 (Uniqueness under Physical Constraints):**

> Within **T**_phys, with topological input (N_c, N_f, |Z₃|) = (3, 3, 3), CG is the unique fixed point of Φ.

**Status:** 🔶 NOVEL ✅ PROVEN — See [Theorem 0.0.31](Theorem-0.0.31-Unconditional-Uniqueness-CG-Fixed-Point.md)

**Resolution:** Theorem 0.0.31 provides three independent proofs:
- **Approach A (Topological Exclusion):** (3, 3, 3) is the only viable input (N_c ≠ 3 excluded phenomenologically by scale requirements)
- **Approach B (Constraint Counting):** System is exactly constrained (5 eq, 5 unknowns)
- **Approach C (Bootstrap Necessity):** Physical constraints force bootstrap equations

**Key clarifications from Thm 0.0.31:**
- N_c ≠ 3 exclusion is **phenomenological** (scale mismatch), not fundamental mathematical inconsistency
- α_s = 1/64 has **independent RG validation** (98.5% agreement with PDG running)
- Classical limit (ℏ → 0) addressed: CG is intrinsically quantum

**Partial evidence:**

1. **DAG structure (Prop 0.0.17y):** The bootstrap equations form a DAG, guaranteeing uniqueness of the observable fixed point.

2. **Dimensional transmutation:** The relation R_stella = ℓ_P · exp((N_c² - 1)²/(2b₀)) has no free parameters once (N_c, N_f) are fixed.

3. **Holographic constraint:** I_stella = I_gravity is a single constraint that fixes the lattice spacing ratio η.

4. **No continuous parameters:** Unlike string theory (moduli) or the Standard Model (~19 parameters), CG has zero free continuous parameters for dimensionless ratios.

### 7.3 Conditional Uniqueness Theorem

**Theorem 7.3.1 (Conditional Uniqueness):**

> If T ∈ **T**_phys is a fixed point of Φ with:
> 1. Σ_T = {(N_c, N_f, |Z₃|) = (3, 3, 3)}
> 2. T satisfies the bootstrap equations (E₁–E₇)
> 3. P_T has DAG structure
>
> Then O_T = O_CG (the observables are uniquely determined).

**Proof:**
From Proposition 0.0.17y, the bootstrap equations with DAG structure have a unique fixed point in observable space. Any theory T satisfying the hypotheses must have:
$$O_T = P_T(\Sigma_T) = P_{CG}(\Sigma_{CG}) = O_{CG}$$
Therefore the observable spaces coincide. □

**Corollary 7.3.2:**
> CG is the unique fixed point among theories with stella geometry and bootstrap dynamics.

## 8. Comparison with Alternative Frameworks

### 8.1 Standard Model

| Property | Standard Model | CG |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Fixed point of Φ? | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Free parameters | ~19 continuous | 0 (for ratios) |
| Self-consistency | External (fitted) | Internal (derived) |
| Observable space | Fitted to data | Predicted from topology |

**Why SM is not a fixed point:** The SM's couplings and masses are fitted to experiment, not predicted. Φ(SM) ≠ SM because SM doesn't predict its own parameters.

**Nuance — SM's Internal Consistency:**

The Standard Model does possess significant internal consistency requirements that should be acknowledged:

1. **Anomaly cancellation:** The SM gauge anomalies (SU(3)³, SU(2)³, U(1)³, SU(3)²U(1), SU(2)²U(1), U(1), gravitational-U(1)²) cancel *exactly* for the observed fermion content. This is a strong constraint — arbitrary fermion charge assignments would not work.

2. **Precision electroweak tests:** The SM passes precision tests at the per-mille level, constraining the Higgs mass from quantum corrections before its direct discovery.

3. **Gauge coupling unification:** Though not exact, the approximate unification at ~10¹⁶ GeV suggests structure beyond coincidence.

4. **Flavor structure:** CKM/PMNS matrices are unitary, reflecting underlying symmetries.

**Distinction from CG:** These SM consistency requirements are *constraints that the parameters must satisfy*, not *predictions of the parameters*. The SM is consistent for a ~19-dimensional surface in parameter space; CG claims this surface shrinks to a unique point (up to scale) when self-prediction is imposed.

**Formal statement:** If we define P_SM: Σ_SM → O_SM where Σ_SM includes the gauge groups and fermion representations, then:
- P_SM(Σ_SM) is a ~19-dimensional constraint surface (anomaly-free, unitary, etc.)
- O_SM^observed ∈ P_SM(Σ_SM) — the observed values satisfy the constraints
- But O_SM^observed ≠ P_SM(Σ_SM) — the constraints don't uniquely determine the observables

Therefore Φ(SM) ≠ SM: the SM predicts *allowed* values, not *unique* values.

## 9. Connection to Lawvere Structure

### 9.1 Relationship to Research-D3

[Research-D3-Category-Theoretic-Formalization.md](Research-D3-Category-Theoretic-Formalization.md) establishes:
- Category **Phys** with objects Obs, Enc
- Holographic encoding φ: Enc → Obs^Enc
- Point-surjectivity ↔ I_stella = I_gravity
- Lawvere fixed-point theorem guarantees existence

**This proposition extends Research-D3:**
- **Phys** operates on configurations/observables (internal)
- **T** operates on theories themselves (external)
- The fixed point in **T** projects to the fixed point in **Phys**

### 9.2 Functorial Relationship

**Proposition 9.2.1 (Obs is Lawvere-Compatible):**

The observable extraction functor Obs: **T** → **Phys** satisfies:
$$\text{Obs}(\Phi(T)) = f_T(\text{Obs}(T))$$
where $f_T$: Obs → Obs is the bootstrap endomorphism for theory T.

**Proof:**
By definition, Obs(Φ(T)) = O'_T = P_T(Σ_T).
The bootstrap map f_T on Obs is exactly P_T ∘ (constraint extraction).
Therefore the diagram commutes. □

**Consequence:** Fixed points of Φ in **T** map to fixed points of f in **Phys**. This connects the theory-level self-consistency to the observable-level bootstrap.

### 9.3 Lawvere Structure in T

**Proposition 9.3.1 (Point-Surjectivity in T):**

> The encoding map φ_T: Σ → O^Σ (constraints to "observable functions of constraints") is point-surjective if and only if the holographic bound is saturated: I_stella = I_gravity.

**Status:** ✅ ESTABLISHED (derived from Research-D3 §3.4)

**Proof (following Research-D3):**

1. **Setup:** Point-surjectivity means every "observation function" g: Σ → O can be encoded by some constraint configuration σ ∈ Σ. In the theory-space context, this means every possible prediction map can be realized.

2. **Information-theoretic reduction:** The maximal information encodable in the constraint structure is bounded by the holographic capacity:
   $$I_{\text{max}}(\Sigma) \leq I_{\text{stella}} = \frac{2\ln(3)}{\sqrt{3}a^2} \times A$$

3. **Information required:** To specify all observable predictions, we need information:
   $$I_{\text{required}} = I_{\text{gravity}} = \frac{A}{4\ell_P^2}$$

4. **Point-surjectivity condition:** φ_T is point-surjective iff I_max(Σ) ≥ I_required:
   $$\frac{2\ln(3)}{\sqrt{3}a^2} \geq \frac{1}{4\ell_P^2}$$

5. **Bootstrap saturation:** The bootstrap equation (Prop 0.0.17v) requires exact equality:
   $$I_{\text{stella}} = I_{\text{gravity}}$$

   This is the *minimum* information capacity needed for self-encoding. Any less and φ_T is not point-surjective (the theory cannot "name" all its observables). Any more would violate the holographic bound. □

**Physical Interpretation:** A theory T can "encode" all possible predictions about itself when its information capacity matches its self-description requirements. For CG, this is precisely the holographic self-encoding condition I_stella = I_gravity that determines the lattice spacing a in terms of ℓ_P.

**Remark:** The point-surjectivity of φ_T in theory space **T** lifts the point-surjectivity of φ: Enc → Obs^Enc in configuration space **Phys**. This connects Lawvere's fixed-point theorem at both levels: configurations (Research-D3) and theories (this proposition).

## 10. Physical Interpretation

### 10.1 Self-Consistency as Existence Condition

The fixed-point condition Φ(T) = T can be interpreted as:

> **A theory exists (is physically realizable) if and only if it is a fixed point of self-prediction.**

Theories that predict different observables than they assume are internally inconsistent and cannot describe reality.

### 10.2 Wheeler's "It from Bit" and the Participatory Universe

Wheeler's vision of a "participatory universe" where observers and reality co-determine each other finds mathematical expression in the fixed-point formalism. This section provides a rigorous information-theoretic interpretation while clarifying the boundary between mathematical content and philosophical interpretation.

#### 10.2.1 The Wheeler Correspondence

Wheeler's slogan "It from Bit" (1990) proposes that physical existence ("It") emerges from information-theoretic processes ("Bit"). In the CG framework, this correspondence becomes:

| Wheeler Concept | CG Formalization | Mathematical Object |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| "Bit" | Topological constraints | Σ_CG = (3, 3, 3) |
| "It" | Physical observables | O_CG ⊂ ℝ⁵₊ |
| "Emergence" | Fixed-point condition | Φ(CG) = CG |
| "Participation" | Self-encoding | I_stella = I_gravity |
| "Observer" | Theory as description | T ∈ **T** |

**Mathematical content:** The fixed-point equation Φ(CG) = CG and the information equality I_stella = I_gravity are precise mathematical statements with proven content (Prop 0.0.17y, §6, §9.3).

**Philosophical interpretation:** Identifying these with Wheeler's "participation" and "observer" is interpretive — it provides conceptual motivation but is not itself a theorem.

#### 10.2.2 Information-Theoretic Formalization

We can sharpen the "It from Bit" slogan into a quantitative statement:

**Proposition 10.2.2 (Information Content of Physical Reality):**

> The information required to specify all dimensionless physical observables in CG equals the holographic information capacity of the stella boundary:
> $$I_{\text{observables}} = I_{\text{stella}} = I_{\text{gravity}}$$
> where:
> - $I_{\text{observables}} = \log_2|\{(\xi, \eta, \zeta, \alpha_s, b_0)\}| = $ finite (single fixed point)
> - $I_{\text{stella}} = \frac{2\ln 3}{\sqrt{3}a^2} \cdot A$ = holographic capacity
> - $I_{\text{gravity}} = \frac{A}{4\ell_P^2}$ = Bekenstein-Hawking bound

**Status:** ✅ ESTABLISHED (consequence of Prop 0.0.17y and holographic bound)

**Proof sketch:**
The bootstrap equations fix observables uniquely, so I_observables is finite (in fact, zero bits of free information once Σ_CG is specified — all observables are determined). The equality I_stella = I_gravity (Prop 0.0.17v) then means the geometric encoding capacity exactly suffices for self-description. No more, no less. □

**Physical interpretation:** The universe carries exactly enough information to describe itself — the holographic principle applied reflexively.

#### 10.2.3 Connection to Landauer's Principle

Landauer's principle (1961) states that erasing one bit of information requires energy ≥ kT ln 2. This connects information to thermodynamics.

**Relevance to CG:**

1. **Information has physical cost:** If the stella boundary encodes I_stella bits, maintaining this encoding requires physical resources. The holographic bound I ≤ A/(4ℓ_P²) is the ultimate limit — at this density, information storage saturates gravitational energy (black hole formation).

2. **Self-encoding at the threshold:** CG's I_stella = I_gravity means the theory operates at the Landauer limit for self-description. A more "descriptive" theory (larger I) would violate the holographic bound; a less descriptive theory (smaller I) couldn't fully encode its own observables.

3. **Reversible computation interpretation:** The fixed-point condition Φ(CG) = CG can be viewed as a computational identity: applying the "compute predictions" operation to CG returns CG unchanged. This is the information-theoretic analog of energy conservation — no information is created or destroyed in self-prediction.

**Formal connection to computational thermodynamics:**

The minimum free energy for self-simulation is:
$$F_{\text{self-sim}} \geq kT \cdot I_{\text{stella}} \cdot \ln 2$$

At Planck temperature T ~ M_P, this becomes:
$$F_{\text{self-sim}} \sim M_P \cdot \frac{A}{4\ell_P^2} \cdot \ln 2 \sim \frac{A \cdot M_P}{\ell_P^2}$$

which is the energy of a black hole of area A. The universe's self-description saturates the computational bounds.

#### 10.2.4 Comparison with Computational Universe Programs

Several research programs have explored "universe as computation":

| Program | Central Claim | CG Relationship |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Wheeler (1990)** | "It from Bit" — physics from yes/no questions | CG: Σ_CG = discrete bits, O_CG = continuous "It" |
| **Landauer (1991)** | Information is physical | CG: I_stella has gravitational mass-energy |
| **Lloyd (2006)** | Universe as quantum computer | CG: Stella encodes and processes information |
| **Wolfram (2002)** | Discrete cellular automaton | CG: Discrete stella topology, continuous field dynamics |
| **Verlinde (2011)** | Entropic gravity | CG: Gravity emerges from information (Thm 5.2.1) |

**CG's distinctive contribution:** Unlike these programs, CG derives the *specific* information content (N_c, N_f, |Z₃|) = (3, 3, 3) from geometric uniqueness (Theorem 0.0.3), then proves this suffices for self-consistent physics. The "computational substrate" is not postulated but derived.

#### 10.2.5 Mathematical Status of Wheeler's Claims

The CG framework has made significant progress toward formalizing Wheeler's intuitions. Here we assess the current mathematical status of each claim:

**✅ Fully Proven:**
- Φ(CG) = CG (fixed-point) — §6
- I_stella = I_gravity (information equality) — Prop 0.0.17v
- Uniqueness of observables given Σ_CG — Thm 0.0.31

**✅ Proven (with existing framework results):**

1. **"Information is ontologically fundamental"**
   - **Status:** ✅ PROVEN in operational sense
   - **Evidence:** [Theorem 0.0.17](Theorem-0.0.17-Information-Geometric-Unification.md) proves that:
     - Space emerges from minimal KL divergence (information distance)
     - Time emerges as geodesic flow in Fisher metric
     - Fisher metric = Killing metric (information geometry = group geometry)
   - **What this proves:** Spacetime structure is *equivalent to* information-geometric structure
   - **What remains open:** Whether information is ontologically *prior* to geometry (strong claim) vs. equivalent (weak claim)

2. **"The universe computes itself"**
   - **Status:** ✅ PROVEN in fixed-point sense
   - **Evidence:**
     - [Prop 0.0.XXb](Proposition-0.0.XXb-Bootstrap-Computability.md): Bootstrap is computable (decidable)
     - Φ(CG) = CG: CG is a quine — applying "compute predictions" returns CG
     - K(O_CG | Σ_CG) ≈ 0: Minimal descriptive complexity (observables add no information beyond constraints)
   - **What this proves:** CG is a computational fixed-point
   - **What remains open:** Whether this is a physical computation or a mathematical identity

3. **"Observers participate in reality"**
   - **Status:** ✅ PROVEN (qualified — see note below)
   - **Evidence:**
     - [Definition 0.0.32](Definition-0.0.32-Internal-Observer.md) (🔶 NOVEL ✅ VERIFIED): Observer defined as internal subsystem $\mathcal{O} = (\mathcal{H}_{obs}, \rho_{obs}, M_{obs})$ with three conditions:
       - **(S) Stability:** Fisher metric positive-definite on observer support
       - **(R) Self-Modeling:** Approximate encoding of observer state (exact encoding impossible for d ≥ 2; pure localized state achieves exact encoding)
       - **(L) Localization:** Observer fits within single Z₃ sector (diam < 2π/3)
     - Definition 0.0.32 also provides:
       - **Classical limit (ℏ→0):** Reduces to classical subsystem observer
       - **Spacetime localization:** Connection to FCC lattice via Theorem 0.0.6
       - **Two-observer interaction:** Composition rules, Wigner's friend resolution
     - [Proposition 0.0.32a](Proposition-0.0.32a-Observer-Fixed-Point.md): Observer fixed-point theorem — F(N) = 3 for N ≥ 3 due to Z₃ superselection; N = 3 is unique stable fixed point
     - [Proposition 0.0.34](Proposition-0.0.34-Observer-Participation.md): $\mathcal{E}_{obs}$ (observer existence) is a **derived consequence** of the bootstrap — one-directional derivation from stella geometry → SU(3) → $N_c = 3$ → Fisher non-degenerate → observer exists
     - [Prop 0.0.17h](Proposition-0.0.17h-Information-Horizon-Derivation.md): Measurement creates information horizons → Z₃ discretization
   - **What this proves:** Observer existence is automatic given the bootstrap structure; observer self-consistency at N = 3 confirms the gauge structure; the derivation is one-directional (bootstrap → observer), not mutual determination
   - **Qualification:** "Participation" in CG means observer constraints are internal to the theory and observer existence is derived (not postulated). It does **not** mean observers independently select $N_c = 3$ — both observer and gauge structure trace to the stella geometry axiom. See Prop 0.0.34 §1.3, §3.2 for detailed discussion.

4. **"Neither information nor geometry is prior"**
   - **Status:** ✅ PROVEN
   - **Evidence:**
     - [Theorem 0.0.33](Theorem-0.0.33-Information-Geometry-Duality.md): Categorical equivalence **InfoGeom$_N$ ≃ LieGeom$_N$** for N ≥ 3
     - [Lemma 0.0.17c](Lemma-0.0.17c-Fisher-Killing-Equivalence.md): Fisher metric ∝ Killing metric on S_N-symmetric manifolds
   - **What this proves:** Information geometry and Lie group geometry are dual descriptions (for N ≥ 3; N = 2 is degenerate)
   - **Resolution:** Neither is ontologically prior — they are categorically equivalent

**⚠️ Philosophical Extensions (consistent but not uniquely implied):**
- That the fixed-point is causally *prior* to physics (vs. atemporal constraint)
- Consciousness or subjective experience (outside CG's scope)

**❌ Not claimed:**
- That CG solves the hard problem of consciousness
- That CG explains why there is something rather than nothing
- That observers are necessary for reality to exist (strong participatory claim)

#### 10.2.6 The "First Stable Principle" and Observer Constraints

A key result supporting the "participation" interpretation is the **First Stable Principle** discovered in [Research-Pure-Information-Bound-On-N.md](../supporting/Research-Pure-Information-Bound-On-N.md):

**Proposition (First Stable Principle):**
$$N^* = \min\{N \in \mathbb{N} : \text{Fisher metric } g^F_N \text{ is positive-definite}\} = 3$$

**Physical interpretation:** An observer can only stably distinguish configurations if the Fisher metric is non-degenerate. The minimum N for which this holds is N = 3. Therefore:

- N = 1, 2: **UNSTABLE** — Observer cannot distinguish configurations (Fisher degenerate)
- N = 3: **FIRST STABLE** — Minimum viable observer complexity
- N > 3: Stable but not minimal

This provides a rigorous sense in which "observers constrain reality": the requirement that observers can distinguish configurations (information-geometric stability) uniquely selects N = 3 → SU(3).

**The derivation chain:**
$$\text{Observer distinguishability} \xrightarrow{\text{First Stable}} N = 3 \xrightarrow{\text{Cartan}} \text{SU}(3) \xrightarrow{\text{bootstrap}} \text{CG}$$

This is perhaps the strongest mathematical realization of Wheeler's participatory principle: the observer's need for distinguishable configurations *selects* the gauge group of physics.

### 10.3 No Fine-Tuning for Dimensionless Ratios

The fixed-point structure explains why CG has no fine-tuning problem:
- Dimensionless ratios are determined by self-consistency
- The only "choice" is the topological input (3, 3, 3)
- Given this input, all ratios are forced by Φ(CG) = CG

## 11. Open Questions

### 11.1 Mathematical Questions

1. **Full uniqueness proof:** Can we prove CG is unique in **T**_phys without assuming bootstrap equations?

2. **Higher categories:** Does **T** have a natural ∞-categorical structure where self-consistency is a homotopy fixed point?

3. **Topos-theoretic formulation:** Is there a topos **E** where CG is an "internal theory" and Φ is an internal endomorphism?

### 11.2 Physical Questions

1. **Other fixed points:** Are there fixed points of Φ with different topological input (N_c ≠ 3)?

2. **Stability of fixed point:** Is CG an "attractor" — do nearby theories flow toward it?

3. **Quantum corrections:** Does the fixed-point structure survive quantum loop corrections?

    - Pedagogical introduction to bootstrap methods
    - Demonstrates how self-consistency can be predictive

**Note on Related Work:** The swampland program and conformal bootstrap represent parallel developments where consistency constraints yield predictive power. CG's bootstrap differs in being a *geometric* rather than algebraic constraint system, but shares the philosophy that self-consistency is a powerful organizing principle. The key distinction is that CG's constraints determine *all* dimensionless ratios uniquely, while swampland criteria typically exclude regions of parameter space without pinpointing a unique solution.

## 14. Appendix: Technical Details

### 14.1 Verification of Category Axioms for T

**Lemma A.1 (T is a category):**

Proof that **T** satisfies category axioms:

1. **Composition is well-defined:**
   Let ι₁: T₁ → T₂ and ι₂: T₂ → T₃. Then ι₂ ∘ ι₁ = (ι₂,C ∘ ι₁,C, ...) is a theory embedding because:
   - Composition of embeddings is an embedding
   - Dynamics compatibility composes
   - Observable preservation composes
   - Constraint inheritance composes

2. **Associativity:**
   (ι₃ ∘ ι₂) ∘ ι₁ = ι₃ ∘ (ι₂ ∘ ι₁) because composition is associative in each component category.

3. **Identity:**
   id_T = (id_C, id_D, id_O, id_Σ) satisfies id_T ∘ ι = ι = ι ∘ id_T by component-wise identity properties. □

### 14.2 Bootstrap Equations (Reference)

For completeness, the seven bootstrap equations from Prop 0.0.17y:

| Eq | Name | Formula | Origin |
|----|------|---------|--------|
| E₁ | Casimir | √σ = ℏc/R_stella | Vacuum energy |
| E₂ | Dim. trans. | R_stella = ℓ_P · exp((N_c²-1)²/(2b₀)) | Asymptotic freedom |
| E₃ | Holographic | a² = (8ln3/√3)ℓ_P² | I_stella = I_gravity |
| E₄ | UV coupling | α_s(M_P) = 1/(N_c²-1)² | Max entropy |
| E₅ | β-function | b₀ = (11N_c - 2N_f)/(12π) | Index theorem |
| E₆ | Definition | M_P = ℏc/ℓ_P | Newton's constant |
| E₇ | Holographic | I_stella = I_gravity | Self-encoding |

### 14.3 Numerical Values

For (N_c, N_f, |Z₃|) = (3, 3, 3):

| Ratio | Value | Numerical |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| ξ = R_stella/ℓ_P | exp(128π/9) | 2.538 × 10¹⁹ |
| η = a/ℓ_P | √(8ln3/√3) | 2.253 |
| ζ = √σ/M_P | exp(-128π/9) | 3.940 × 10⁻²⁰ |
| α_s(M_P) | 1/64 | 0.01563 |
| b₀ | 9/(4π) | 0.7162 |

**⚠️ Important: α_s(M_P) Framework Prediction**

The value α_s(M_P) = 1/64 ≈ 0.0156 is a **CG framework prediction** derived from maximum entropy (Prop 0.0.17w).

**Independent Validation via RG Running:**

Running the observed coupling from M_Z to M_P using one-loop pure QCD:
$$\frac{1}{\alpha_s(M_P)} = \frac{1}{\alpha_s(M_Z)} + 2b_0 \ln\frac{M_P}{M_Z} = 8.47 + 56.49 = 64.96$$

| Route | 1/α_s(M_P) | Source |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Maximum entropy | 64.00 | Theoretical prediction (Prop 0.0.17w) |
| RG from PDG α_s(M_Z) | 64.96 | Independent phenomenology |
| **Agreement** | **98.5%** | — |

**Comparison with "Standard" Extrapolations:**

"Standard" extrapolations yielding α_s(M_P) ≈ 0.02–0.04 typically assume GUT thresholds and/or SUSY particles modifying the RG flow. CG assumes **pure QCD with three light flavors** to M_P. The 98.5% agreement between maximum entropy and pure QCD running supports this assumption.

**Physical origin:**
- **Standard with GUT/SUSY:** Threshold corrections alter running at ~10¹⁶ GeV
- **CG framework:** No new thresholds; α_s(M_P) = 1/64 from maximum entropy over 64 adj⊗adj channels

The tension with "standard" extrapolations reflects **different assumptions about high-energy physics**, not an error in CG. See [Theorem 0.0.31 §9.2](Theorem-0.0.31-Unconditional-Uniqueness-CG-Fixed-Point.md) for detailed discussion.

**Testability:** While α_s(M_P) itself is not directly measurable, the framework's downstream predictions (√σ, f_π, fermion masses) that depend on this value are testable and show agreement with data.
