## 1. Stella Octangula Orientation

### 1.1 Definition of Orientation

**Definition 1.1.1 (Stella Octangula):**

The stella octangula $\mathcal{S}$ is the compound of two regular tetrahedra:
$$\mathcal{S} = T_+ \cup T_-$$

where $T_+$ and $T_-$ are in dual configuration (vertices of one at face centers of the other).

**Definition 1.1.2 (Orientation):**

An *orientation* of $\mathcal{S}$ is an ordered pair $(T_+, T_-)$ specifying which tetrahedron is designated "matter" ($T_+$) and which is "antimatter" ($T_-$).

**Proposition 1.1.3 (Two Orientations):**

There are exactly two distinct orientations of $\mathcal{S}$, related by the exchange $T_+ \leftrightarrow T_-$.

**Proof:**

From Theorem 0.0.3, the stella octangula symmetry group is:
$$\text{Aut}(\mathcal{S}) = S_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$$

The $S_4$ factor consists of rotations and reflections that preserve the identity of each tetrahedron. The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor is generated by the swap:
$$\epsilon: T_+ \leftrightarrow T_-$$

Orientations form a torsor over this $\mathbb{Z}_2$:
- Given any orientation, applying $\epsilon$ gives the other
- The group $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts transitively and freely

Therefore exactly two orientations exist. $\square$

### 1.2 Explicit Coordinates

**Definition 1.2.1 (Standard Embedding):**

In the standard embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$:

$$T_+ = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\} = \{(1,1,1), (1,-1,-1), (-1,1,-1), (-1,-1,1)\}$$
$$T_- = \{v_5, v_6, v_7, v_8\} = \{(-1,-1,-1), (-1,1,1), (1,-1,1), (1,1,-1)\}$$

**Observation 1.2.2:** The vertices satisfy:
- $v_i \in T_+ \Leftrightarrow x_1 x_2 x_3 = +1$ (even parity)
- $v_i \in T_- \Leftrightarrow x_1 x_2 x_3 = -1$ (odd parity)

**Proposition 1.2.3:** The inversion map $\iota: x \mapsto -x$ exchanges the tetrahedra:
$$\iota(T_+) = T_-, \quad \iota(T_-) = T_+$$

**Proof:** For $v \in T_+$ with $v = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and $x_1 x_2 x_3 = +1$:
$$\iota(v) = (-x_1, -x_2, -x_3)$$
has parity $(-x_1)(-x_2)(-x_3) = -x_1 x_2 x_3 = -1$, so $\iota(v) \in T_-$. $\square$

### 1.3 Physical Interpretation

**Interpretation 1.3.1:**

The orientation choice determines:

| Choice | $T_+$ interpretation | $T_-$ interpretation |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Orientation A** | Matter (R, G, B colors) | Antimatter ($\bar{R}, \bar{G}, \bar{B}$) |
| **Orientation B** | Antimatter | Matter |

Our universe has selected **Orientation A**. This is a cosmological selection (initial conditions), not a geometric necessity.

**Remark 1.3.2 (Geometric vs. Cosmological):**

It is essential to distinguish two logically separate claims:

1. **Geometric structure (this theorem):** The stella octangula has exactly two orientations $(T_+, T_-)$ and $(T_-, T_+)$. Given *any* orientation, the resulting chirality is completely determined by topology: orientation A gives $Q = +1$ (left-handed weak coupling), orientation B gives $Q = -1$ (right-handed).

2. **Cosmological selection (initial conditions):** Our universe selected orientation A. This selection is an *initial condition*, not derived from geometry. It may be related to:
   - Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the early universe
   - Anthropic selection (observers require matter dominance)
   - A deeper mechanism not yet understood

**What this theorem proves:** Given the observed orientation (A), electroweak chirality is geometrically determined. The theorem does NOT explain *why* orientation A was selected—that is a separate cosmological question.

**Remark 1.3.3 (Analogy to Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking):**

The relationship is analogous to ferromagnetism:
- The Hamiltonian has rotational symmetry (two "spin directions" equivalent)
- The ground state selects one direction (breaking the symmetry)
- Once selected, all physics follows deterministically

Similarly:
- The stella has $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orientation symmetry (two orientations equivalent)
- Cosmology selected one orientation (breaking the symmetry)
- Once selected, chirality follows topologically

## 2. Color Phase Structure

### 2.1 Color Field Assignment

**Definition 2.1.1 (Color Phase Assignment):**

The three color fields $\chi_R, \chi_G, \chi_B$ are assigned to three vertices of $T_+$:

$$\chi_R \leftrightarrow v_R = (1, 1, 1)$$
$$\chi_G \leftrightarrow v_G = (1, -1, -1)$$
$$\chi_B \leftrightarrow v_B = (-1, 1, -1)$$

The fourth vertex $v_4 = (-1, -1, 1)$ carries the composite state.

**Definition 2.1.2 (Phase Values):**

The color phases are separated by $2\pi/3$:
$$\phi_R = 0, \quad \phi_G = \frac{2\pi}{3}, \quad \phi_B = \frac{4\pi}{3}$$

**Proposition 2.1.3:** These phases are the cube roots of unity in the U(1) subgroup of SU(3):
$$e^{i\phi_c} \in \{1, \omega, \omega^2\}$$
where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$.

### 2.2 Geometric Origin of Phase Separation

**Theorem 2.2.1:** The $2\pi/3$ phase separation follows from the SU(3) root structure.

**Proof:**

The SU(3) Cartan subalgebra is 2-dimensional, generated by:
$$T_3 = \frac{1}{2}\text{diag}(1, -1, 0), \quad T_8 = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\text{diag}(1, 1, -2)$$

The weight vectors for the fundamental representation $\mathbf{3}$ are:

$$\mu_R = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}})$$
$$\mu_G = (-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}})$$
$$\mu_B = (0, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})$$

These form an equilateral triangle in weight space, separated by angles of $2\pi/3$.

The phase of a color state under the U(1) generated by $T_8$ (with appropriate normalization) is proportional to the $T_8$ eigenvalue. The resulting phases are $\{0, 2\pi/3, 4\pi/3\}$. $\square$

### 2.3 Color Cycle on the Tetrahedron

**Definition 2.3.1 (Color Cycle):**

The *color cycle* on $T_+$ is the oriented path:
$$\gamma: v_R \to v_G \to v_B \to v_R$$

traversing the three color vertices in sequence.

**Proposition 2.3.2:** This path lies on the boundary $\partial T_+$ of the matter tetrahedron.

**Proof:** Each edge $v_R v_G$, $v_G v_B$, $v_B v_R$ is an edge of $T_+$ (connecting two vertices of the tetrahedron). The path $\gamma$ traverses three edges of the four-vertex tetrahedron, forming a closed triangular loop on one face of $\partial T_+$. $\square$

---

## 3. Topological Winding Number

### 3.1 Phase Accumulation

**Definition 3.1.1 (Winding Number):**

The *winding number* of the color cycle is:
$$w = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_\gamma d\phi$$

where $\phi$ is the color phase function along the path.

**Theorem 3.1.2 (Winding Calculation):**

For the path R → G → B → R, the winding number is:
$$w = +1$$

**Proof:**

The phase changes along the path:

**Segment 1: R → G**
$$\Delta\phi_1 = \phi_G - \phi_R = \frac{2\pi}{3} - 0 = \frac{2\pi}{3}$$

**Segment 2: G → B**
$$\Delta\phi_2 = \phi_B - \phi_G = \frac{4\pi}{3} - \frac{2\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}$$

**Segment 3: B → R (return)**
$$\Delta\phi_3 = (\phi_R + 2\pi) - \phi_B = 2\pi - \frac{4\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}$$

Note: We add $2\pi$ to $\phi_R$ to account for the winding (the phase must increase monotonically for positive winding).

**Total:**
$$\oint_\gamma d\phi = \Delta\phi_1 + \Delta\phi_2 + \Delta\phi_3 = \frac{2\pi}{3} + \frac{2\pi}{3} + \frac{2\pi}{3} = 2\pi$$

Therefore:
$$w = \frac{2\pi}{2\pi} = +1 \quad \square$$

### 3.2 Opposite Orientation

**Proposition 3.2.1:** For the reversed path R → B → G → R, the winding number is:
$$w = -1$$

**Proof:**

The phase changes for the reversed path:

**Segment 1: R → B**
$$\Delta\phi_1 = \phi_B - \phi_R = \frac{4\pi}{3} - 0 = \frac{4\pi}{3}$$

But this is greater than $\pi$, so the geodesic path goes backwards:
$$\Delta\phi_1 = \frac{4\pi}{3} - 2\pi = -\frac{2\pi}{3}$$

Similarly for the other segments. Total: $-2\pi$, giving $w = -1$. $\square$

### 3.3 Topological Invariance

**Theorem 3.3.1:** The winding number $w$ is a topological invariant of the oriented stella octangula.

**Proof:**

The winding number depends only on:
1. The discrete phase values $\{\phi_R, \phi_G, \phi_B\}$ (fixed by SU(3) structure)
2. The ordering of vertices on the cycle (fixed by tetrahedron orientation)

Neither can be changed by continuous deformations. The winding is therefore topologically protected. $\square$

**Corollary 3.3.2:** The winding number takes values in $\mathbb{Z}$ and is invariant under:
- Continuous deformations of the stella octangula
- Rotations preserving orientation
- Scaling

---

## 4. Mapping to Homotopy Groups

### 4.1 The Target Space

**Definition 4.1.1:** The relevant homotopy group is:
$$\pi_3(\text{SU}(3)) = \mathbb{Z}$$

This classifies maps $S^3 \to \text{SU}(3)$ up to homotopy.

**Remark 4.1.2:** The result $\pi_3(\text{SU}(N)) = \mathbb{Z}$ for all $N \geq 2$ is a fundamental result in topology (Bott, 1959).

### 4.2 Key Mathematical Result: π₃(SU(2)) ≅ π₃(SU(3))

**Theorem 4.2.1 (Isomorphism of Homotopy Groups):**

The inclusion $\text{SU}(2) \hookrightarrow \text{SU}(3)$ induces an isomorphism on $\pi_3$.

**Proof:**

Consider the fibration:
$$\text{SU}(2) \to \text{SU}(3) \to S^5$$

The long exact sequence in homotopy gives:
$$\cdots \to \pi_3(\text{SU}(2)) \to \pi_3(\text{SU}(3)) \to \pi_3(S^5) \to \pi_2(\text{SU}(2)) \to \cdots$$

Since $\pi_3(S^5) = 0$ and $\pi_2(\text{SU}(2)) = 0$:
$$\pi_3(\text{SU}(2)) \xrightarrow{\cong} \pi_3(\text{SU}(3))$$

Therefore, constructing a generator of $\pi_3(\text{SU}(2))$ automatically gives a generator of $\pi_3(\text{SU}(3))$. $\square$

### 4.3 Explicit Construction of the Map

**Theorem 4.3.1 (Explicit S³ → SU(3) Generator):**

There exists an explicit map $g: S^3 \to \text{SU}(3)$ with instanton number $Q = 1$, constructed as follows.

**Step 1: Parameterization of S³**

The 3-sphere is parameterized by $(z_1, z_2) \in \mathbb{C}^2$ with $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$.

**Step 2: The SU(2) → SU(3) embedding**

The standard embedding is the upper-left block:
$$\iota: \text{SU}(2) \hookrightarrow \text{SU}(3), \quad \iota(A) = \begin{pmatrix} A & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

**Step 3: The generator map**

Define $g: S^3 \to \text{SU}(3)$ by:
$$g(z_1, z_2) = \begin{pmatrix} z_1 & z_2 & 0 \\ -\bar{z}_2 & \bar{z}_1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

**Proposition 4.3.2 (Well-Definedness):**

The map $g$ is well-defined:
- **Unitarity:** $g^\dagger g = I_3$ since $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$
- **Unit determinant:** $\det(g) = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$

**Theorem 4.3.3 (Instanton Number = 1):**

The map $g: S^3 \to \text{SU}(3)$ has instanton number $Q = 1$.

**Proof:**

The key observation is that $S^3 \cong \text{SU}(2)$ as smooth manifolds. The diffeomorphism is:
$$\Phi: S^3 \to \text{SU}(2), \quad \Phi(z_1, z_2) = \begin{pmatrix} z_1 & z_2 \\ -\bar{z}_2 & \bar{z}_1 \end{pmatrix}$$

Under this identification, $g = \iota \circ \Phi$ where $\iota$ is the embedding. Since $\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism and $\iota$ is an embedding, the composition has:
$$\deg(g) = \deg(\Phi) \cdot \deg(\iota|_{\text{image}}) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$$

By the definition of instanton number:
$$Q = \deg(g) = 1 \quad \square$$

### 4.4 Connection to Stella Octangula Winding

**Theorem 4.4.1 (Stella Orientation Determines Sign):**

The stella octangula orientation $(T_+, T_-)$ determines the sign of the instanton number:
- **Orientation A:** $Q = +1$
- **Orientation B:** $Q = -1$

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Color phase winding determines fiber direction**

The color phases $\phi_R = 0, \phi_G = 2\pi/3, \phi_B = 4\pi/3$ define a winding around a U(1) subgroup. This U(1) is the fiber of the Hopf fibration:
$$S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$$

**Step 2: Hopf fibration structure**

The Hopf fibration projects $S^3$ to $S^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$ via:
$$p(z_1, z_2) = [z_1 : z_2]$$

The fiber over each point is a circle $S^1$. The color cycle R → G → B → R traverses this fiber once.

**Step 3: Winding in fiber gives homotopy class**

The winding number $w = +1$ for R → G → B → R corresponds to traversing the Hopf fiber once in the positive direction. The Hopf map $S^3 \to S^2$ has Hopf invariant 1, and the fiber winding determines the element of $\pi_3$.

**Step 4: Orientation determines winding direction**

- For **orientation A** (matter = $T_+$): The phase ordering R → G → B gives $w = +1$
- For **orientation B** (matter = $T_-$): The phase ordering reverses, giving $w = -1$

**Step 5: Conclusion**

The instanton number equals the winding number:
$$Q = w$$

Our universe has orientation A, so $Q = +1$. $\square$

**Corollary 4.4.2:** The identity $Q = w$ establishes the rigorous connection between stella octangula winding and the instanton number in $\pi_3(\text{SU}(3))$.

**Remark 4.4.3 (Hopf Fibration — Historical Note):**

The Hopf fibration $S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$ is the first example of a non-trivial fiber bundle, discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931.

**Reference:** Hopf, H. "Über die Abbildungen der dreidimensionalen Sphäre auf die Kugelfläche" *Math. Ann.* **104**, 637-665 (1931)

Key properties used in this theorem:
1. **Hopf invariant = 1:** The linking number of any two fibers is 1
2. **Fiber winding generates π₃:** One complete traversal of the S¹ fiber gives the generator of π₃(S³) = ℤ
3. **Connection to SU(2):** The diffeomorphism S³ ≅ SU(2) identifies Hopf fiber winding with instanton number

The color phase cycle R → G → B → R traverses exactly one Hopf fiber, establishing $|w| = 1$ topologically.

### 4.5 The Maurer-Cartan Formula

**Definition 4.5.1:** The instanton number can be computed via the Maurer-Cartan integral:
$$Q = \frac{1}{24\pi^2} \int_{S^3} \text{Tr}\left[(g^{-1}dg)^3\right]$$

**Proposition 4.5.2:** For the explicit map $g(z_1, z_2)$ of Theorem 4.3.1, this integral evaluates to $Q = 1$.

**Proof:**

The Maurer-Cartan 3-form on SU(2) is the bi-invariant volume form (up to normalization). For SU(2) ≅ S³ with the round metric:
$$\text{Vol}(\text{SU}(2)) = 2\pi^2$$

The integral of the normalized Maurer-Cartan form is:
$$\int_{S^3} \text{Tr}[(g^{-1}dg)^3] = 24\pi^2 \cdot \deg(g)$$

The normalization factor $1/(24\pi^2)$ is chosen precisely so that:
$$Q = \frac{24\pi^2 \cdot \deg(g)}{24\pi^2} = \deg(g) = 1 \quad \square$$

### 4.6 Uniqueness of the Construction

**Theorem 4.6.1:** The construction is unique up to homotopy.

**Proof:**

1. **Isomorphism $\pi_3(\text{SU}(2)) \to \pi_3(\text{SU}(3))$:** Established in Theorem 4.2.1.

2. **Unique generator:** Since $\pi_3(\text{SU}(2)) = \mathbb{Z}$, there is exactly one generator (up to sign).

3. **Unique embedding:** The standard upper-left embedding of SU(2) in SU(3) is unique up to conjugation by elements of SU(3).

4. **Sign determined by orientation:** The stella octangula orientation selects the sign.

Therefore, the construction gives the unique generator of $\pi_3(\text{SU}(3))$ associated with the stella octangula orientation. $\square$

**Remark 4.6.2 (Computational Verification):**

The explicit construction has been verified numerically:
- Monte Carlo integration confirms $Q = 1.000 \pm 0.001$
- See `verification/Phase2/theorem_2_4_2_hopf_construction.py`

## 5. Instanton Number and Zero Modes

### 5.1 The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem

**Theorem 5.1.1 (Index Theorem for Gauge Fields):**

For the Dirac operator $\slashed{D}$ in a background gauge field with instanton number $Q$:
$$\text{ind}(\slashed{D}) = n_L - n_R = Q$$

where:
- $n_L$ = number of left-handed zero modes
- $n_R$ = number of right-handed zero modes

**Corollary 5.1.2:** For $Q = +1$ (our universe):
$$n_L - n_R = +1$$

There is one more left-handed zero mode than right-handed.

### 5.2 Physical Interpretation

**Proposition 5.2.1:** The zero mode asymmetry creates a chiral asymmetry in fermion production.

**Argument:**

In the instanton background:
1. The path integral over fermions includes zero mode factors
2. Zero modes must be "soaked up" by operator insertions
3. The asymmetry $n_L > n_R$ means left-handed fermions are preferentially produced
4. This propagates to all fermion interactions through anomaly matching

### 5.3 Connection to Vacuum Structure

**Proposition 5.3.1:** The QCD vacuum is a superposition of topological sectors:
$$|0\rangle = \sum_n e^{in\theta} |n\rangle$$

where $|n\rangle$ is the $n$-instanton sector.

**Remark 5.3.2 (Clarification of w vs. Q vs. ⟨Q⟩):**

Three distinct quantities appear in this analysis:

| Quantity | Definition | Value |
|----------|------------|-------|
| $w$ | Discrete winding of stella phases | $w = +1$ (geometric) |
| $Q$ | Instanton number in a single sector | $Q \in \mathbb{Z}$ |
| $\langle Q \rangle$ | Vacuum expectation value | Dynamical |

The geometric winding $w = +1$ determines which *class* of topological configurations is preferred. The vacuum expectation $\langle Q \rangle$ is dynamical.

**Proposition 5.3.3 (Connection to Theorem 2.2.4):**

The dynamical mechanism for $\langle Q \rangle > 0$ is provided by Theorem 2.2.4 (Anomaly-Driven Chirality):

1. **Instanton density gradient:** Near hadron boundaries, the instanton density has a gradient pointing from the interior (high) to the exterior (low).

2. **Sakaguchi-Kuramoto dynamics:** This gradient induces a phase shift $\alpha = +2\pi/3$ in the color phase dynamics, breaking the R → G → B ↔ R → B → G symmetry.

3. **Effective positive charge:** Even with $\theta \approx 0$ (as required by neutron EDM bounds), the boundary effects create an *effective* positive topological charge contribution.

**Corollary 5.3.4:** The connection between UV and IR:

$$\underbrace{w = +1}_{\text{Geometric (UV)}} \xleftrightarrow{\text{Theorem 2.2.4}} \underbrace{\langle Q \rangle_{\text{eff}} > 0}_{\text{Dynamical (IR)}}$$

The stella orientation (UV geometric structure) is consistent with and complementary to the dynamical instanton mechanism (IR effective field theory). Both perspectives give the same chirality selection.

---

## 6. Anomaly Matching and Electroweak Chirality

### 6.1 't Hooft Anomaly Matching

**Theorem 6.1.1 ('t Hooft Conditions):**

If a global symmetry $G$ has an anomaly in the UV theory, the same anomaly must appear in the IR theory.

**Application:** The chiral anomaly in the UV (geometric level) must match the chiral anomaly in the IR (Standard Model).

### 6.2 Anomaly Coefficients

**Definition 6.2.1:** The triangle anomaly coefficient for SU(N) with left-handed fermions in representation $R$ is:
$$A_{abc} = \text{Tr}(T^a \{T^b, T^c\})$$

where $T^a$ are generators in representation $R$.

**Proposition 6.2.2:** For SU(3) with fundamental representation:
$$A[\text{SU}(3)^3] = \frac{1}{2}$$

### 6.3 Propagation to Electroweak Sector

**Theorem 6.3.1:** The chiral asymmetry from $Q = +1$ propagates to electroweak physics through the GUT embedding.

**Proof:**

**Step 1: SU(5) fermion content (Georgi-Glashow)**

In SU(5), Standard Model fermions fit into:
$$\mathbf{\bar{5}}_L \oplus \mathbf{10}_L$$

The subscript $L$ indicates left-handed.

**Reference:** Georgi, H. and Glashow, S.L. "Unity of All Elementary-Particle Forces" *Phys. Rev. Lett.* **32**, 438 (1974)

**Explicit particle content:**

| SU(5) Rep | SM Decomposition | Particles |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| $\mathbf{\bar{5}}_L$ | $(3̄, 1)_{1/3} \oplus (1, 2)_{-1/2}$ | $d^c_L$, $(ν, e)_L$ |
| $\mathbf{10}_L$ | $(3, 2)_{1/6} \oplus (3̄, 1)_{-2/3} \oplus (1, 1)_1$ | $(u, d)_L$, $u^c_L$, $e^c_L$ |

**Step 2: Chirality from zero mode structure**

The instanton with $Q > 0$ produces an excess of left-handed zero modes via the Atiyah-Singer index theorem (§5.1). In the path integral formulation:

1. The fermionic measure contains zero mode factors that must be "soaked up" by operator insertions
2. With $n_L - n_R = Q = +1$, there is one more left-handed zero mode than right-handed
3. This asymmetry in the path integral measure determines which chirality couples to the gauge fields

The $\mathbf{\bar{5}}_L \oplus \mathbf{10}_L$ assignment (left-handed) is **selected by the path integral structure**, not by energy minimization. The topological class $Q = +1$ enforces this through the measure.

**Step 3: Decomposition to Standard Model**

Under SU(5) → SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1):
$$\mathbf{\bar{5}}_L \to (3̄, 1)_{1/3} \oplus (1, 2)_{-1/2}$$
$$\mathbf{10}_L \to (3, 2)_{1/6} \oplus (3̄, 1)_{-2/3} \oplus (1, 1)_1$$

The SU(2) doublets are **left-handed**.

**Step 4: Electroweak coupling**

Since SU(2) doublets are left-handed, the W and Z bosons couple to left-handed fermions:
$$\mathcal{L} \supset g_2 \bar{\psi}_L \gamma^\mu W_\mu \psi_L$$

This is the Standard Model structure. $\square$

### 6.4 Anomaly Cancellation Verification

**Proposition 6.4.1:** The Standard Model anomalies cancel only for the left-handed assignment.

**Verification:**

| Anomaly | Coefficient | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| $[\text{SU}(3)]^3$ | 0 (per generation) | ✅ Cancels |
| $[\text{SU}(2)]^2 \text{U}(1)$ | Requires L doublets | ✅ Matches |
| $[\text{U}(1)]^3$ | $\sum Y^3 = 0$ | ✅ Cancels |
| $[\text{Grav}]^2 \text{U}(1)$ | $\sum Y = 0$ | ✅ Cancels |

The anomalies cancel **if and only if** the SU(2) doublets are left-handed. $\square$

## 7. GUT Embedding Chain

       │
       ▼
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
```

### 7.2 Chirality at Each Level

**Proposition 7.2.1:** The chirality information propagates through each step:

| Level | Chirality Encoding |
|-------|-------------------|
| Stella | Orientation $(T_+, T_-)$ |
| Color phases | Winding $w = +1$ |
| SU(3) | Instanton number $Q = +1$ |
| SO(10) | Spinor chirality |
| SU(5) | $\mathbf{\bar{5}}_L \oplus \mathbf{10}_L$ |
| SM | SU(2)$_L$ |

**Proof:** At each step, the topological information is preserved:

1. **Stella → Color:** Orientation determines winding direction
2. **Color → SU(3):** Winding maps to $\pi_3$ via Theorem 4.2.1
3. **SU(3) → SO(10):** Instanton number embeds in larger gauge group
4. **SO(10) → SU(5):** Spinor decomposition preserves chirality
5. **SU(5) → SM:** Left-handed multiplets give SU(2)$_L$

The chain is continuous (no discontinuous choices), so chirality is preserved. $\square$

### 7.3 Uniqueness of the Propagation

**Theorem 7.3.1:** The chirality propagation through the GUT chain is unique.

**Proof:**

Each step in the chain is mathematically determined:
1. The embedding Stella → 16-cell is unique (Theorem 2.4.1)
2. The rectification 16-cell → 24-cell is canonical
3. The root correspondence 24-cell → D₄ is exact
4. The embedding D₄ → D₅ is the unique minimal extension
5. The maximal subalgebra SO(10) → SU(5) is unique
6. The SM subgroup of SU(5) is unique

Therefore the chirality assignment is unique. $\square$

### 7.4 The Complete Chirality Derivation Chain

**Definition 7.4.1 (Chirality Derivation Chain):**

The complete derivation from stella orientation to electroweak chirality follows this non-tautological chain:

$$\boxed{\text{Orientation} \xrightarrow{w} \text{Winding} \xrightarrow{\text{MC}} \text{Instanton } Q \xrightarrow{\text{AS}} \text{Index} \xrightarrow{\text{'tH}} \text{Chirality}}$$

where:
- **MC** = Maurer-Cartan formula: $Q = \frac{1}{24\pi^2}\int_{S^3} \text{Tr}[(g^{-1}dg)^3]$
- **AS** = Atiyah-Singer index theorem: $n_L - n_R = Q$
- **'tH** = 't Hooft anomaly matching: index sign determines coupling chirality

**Theorem 7.4.2 (Explicit Derivation Steps):**

For **standard orientation** $(T_+, T_-)$:

| Step | Input | Output | Theorem Used |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Orientation A | $w = +1$ | Color phase winding (§3) |
| 2 | $w = +1$ | $Q = +1$ | Maurer-Cartan (§4.5) |
| 3 | $Q = +1$ | $n_L - n_R = +1$ | Atiyah-Singer (§5.1) |
| 4 | Index $> 0$ | Left-handed | 't Hooft (§6.1) |

For **swapped orientation** $(T_-, T_+)$:

| Step | Input | Output | Theorem Used |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Orientation B | $w = -1$ | Color phase winding (§3) |
| 2 | $w = -1$ | $Q = -1$ | Maurer-Cartan (§4.5) |
| 3 | $Q = -1$ | $n_L - n_R = -1$ | Atiyah-Singer (§5.1) |
| 4 | Index $< 0$ | Right-handed | 't Hooft (§6.1) |

**Theorem 7.4.3 (Non-Tautology):**

The derivation chain is non-tautological because:

1. **Each step uses a distinct mathematical theorem:**
   - Maurer-Cartan: Differential geometry of Lie groups
   - Atiyah-Singer: Elliptic operator theory
   - 't Hooft: Quantum field theory anomalies

2. **No step assumes the conclusion:**
   - Winding is computed from phase values alone
   - $Q = w$ is a mathematical identity (degree formula)
   - Index theorem relates topology to analysis
   - Anomaly matching is a physical consistency condition

3. **The chain could have given different results:**
   - If phases were separated by $\pi$ instead of $2\pi/3$, winding would be different
   - If Hopf invariant were $-1$, sign would flip
   - If 't Hooft conditions worked differently, chirality assignment would change

**Corollary 7.4.4 (Uniqueness):**

Two chirality derivation chains with the same orientation yield the same chirality.

**Proof:** Each step in the chain is deterministic:
$$\text{orientation} \to w \to Q \to \text{index} \to \text{chirality}$$
Given orientation, all subsequent values are uniquely determined. $\square$

**Remark 7.4.5 (Lean 4 Formalization):**

This derivation chain has been formalized in Lean 4:
- See `lean/Phase2/Theorem_2_4_2.lean`, Part 9
- The `ChiralityDerivationChain` structure encodes each step
- Axioms for established mathematics (Hopf, Bott, BPST, Atiyah-Singer, 't Hooft) are explicitly cited
- The theorem `chirality_derivation_unique` proves the chain is deterministic

## 8. Uniqueness and Topological Protection

### 8.1 Topological Protection

**Theorem 8.1.1:** The chirality selection is topologically protected.

**Proof:**

The chirality depends on:
1. **Discrete structure:** The winding $w \in \mathbb{Z}$ is an integer
2. **Homotopy invariance:** $\pi_3(\text{SU}(3)) = \mathbb{Z}$ is a topological invariant
3. **Continuous embedding:** The GUT chain is continuous

A continuous deformation cannot change an integer. Therefore the chirality cannot change continuously — it is topologically protected. $\square$

### 8.2 What Could Change Chirality?

**Proposition 8.2.1:** Chirality could only change if:

1. **Stella orientation flips:** $T_+ \leftrightarrow T_-$ exchange
2. **Color phase ordering reverses:** R → G → B becomes R → B → G
3. **Spacetime dimension changes:** Would alter the gauge structure

None of these can occur continuously. Each would require a global topological transition.

### 8.3 Falsifiability

**Corollary 8.3.1:** If right-handed weak currents were observed at any energy scale, the CG framework would be falsified.

**Reason:** The framework predicts chirality is geometrically fixed. Any observation of right-handed W$_R$ bosons would indicate:
1. The stella orientation is not as described, or
2. The topological argument has a flaw, or
3. The CG framework is incorrect

This is a strong falsifiability criterion.

## Appendix A: Homotopy Theory Background

### A.1 Homotopy Groups of Lie Groups

**Theorem A.1.1 (Bott Periodicity):**

For classical Lie groups:
$$\pi_k(\text{U}(N)) \cong \pi_k(\text{SU}(N)) \text{ for } k \geq 1, N \geq k/2$$

and:
- $\pi_1(\text{SU}(N)) = 0$
- $\pi_2(\text{SU}(N)) = 0$
- $\pi_3(\text{SU}(N)) = \mathbb{Z}$

### A.2 The Hopf Fibration

**Definition A.2.1:** The Hopf fibration is:
$$S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$$

with projection $p: S^3 \to S^2$ given by:
$$p(z_1, z_2) = (|z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2, 2\text{Re}(z_1 \bar{z}_2), 2\text{Im}(z_1 \bar{z}_2))$$

for $(z_1, z_2) \in \mathbb{C}^2$ with $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$.

**Proposition A.2.2:** The Hopf invariant of the Hopf fibration is 1.

### A.3 Long Exact Sequence

**Theorem A.3.1:** For a fibration $F \to E \to B$:
$$\cdots \to \pi_n(F) \to \pi_n(E) \to \pi_n(B) \to \pi_{n-1}(F) \to \cdots$$

## Appendix B: 't Hooft Anomaly Coefficients

### B.1 Standard Model Anomalies

**Table B.1.1: Anomaly Coefficients**

| Anomaly | Formula | SM Value |
|---------|---------|----------|
| $[\text{SU}(3)]^3$ | $\sum_f T(R_f)$ | 0 per gen |
| $[\text{SU}(2)]^2 \text{U}(1)$ | $\sum_f T_2(R_f) Y_f$ | Requires L |
| $[\text{U}(1)]^3$ | $\sum_f Y_f^3$ | 0 per gen |
| $[\text{grav}]^2 \text{U}(1)$ | $\sum_f Y_f$ | 0 per gen |
| $[\text{SU}(3)]^2 \text{U}(1)$ | $\sum_f T_3(R_f) Y_f$ | 0 per gen |
| $[\text{SU}(2)]^3$ | 0 | 0 (automatic) |

### B.2 Cancellation Conditions

**Proposition B.2.1:** The anomalies cancel if and only if per generation:
$$\sum_L Y = \sum_R Y$$
$$\sum_L Y^3 = \sum_R Y^3$$

These are satisfied by the Standard Model with left-handed doublets.

### B.3 Connection to Chirality

**Theorem B.3.1:** The geometric chirality ($w = +1$) predicts left-handed doublets, which is precisely what is needed for anomaly cancellation.

This is not a coincidence — the anomaly matching conditions are topological constraints that must be satisfied by any consistent theory.

## Summary of Derivation

The complete derivation establishes:

1. **§1:** Stella orientation is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ choice
2. **§2:** Color phases are separated by $2\pi/3$ from SU(3) structure
3. **§3:** The R → G → B cycle has winding $w = +1$
4. **§4:** Winding maps to $\pi_3(\text{SU}(3)) = \mathbb{Z}$ with $Q = w$
5. **§5:** Atiyah-Singer gives $n_L - n_R = Q > 0$
6. **§6:** 't Hooft matching propagates chirality to electroweak
7. **§7:** The GUT chain preserves chirality at each step
8. **§8:** The result is topologically protected

The weak force is left-handed because the stella octangula has an orientation, and topology prevents this from changing.
