      "description": "Configuration space C \u2245 T\u00b2 vs S\u00b9",
      "status": "RESOLVED",
      "resolution": "Configuration space is correctly T\u00b2 (Cartan torus). Definition 0.1.2 specifies the EQUILIBRIUM POINT on this torus, not the entire configuration space. The T\u00b2 parameterizes all possible phase configurations satisfying the constraint \u03c6_R + \u03c6_G + \u03c6_B = 0 (mod 2\u03c0).",
      "key_insight": "The constraint \u03c6_R + \u03c6_G + \u03c6_B = 0 is EQUIVALENT to the U(1) quotient, so dim = 3 - 1 = 2, giving T\u00b2."

      "description": "Fisher-Killing equivalence proof",
      "status": "RESOLVED",
      "resolution": "Proven via S\u2083 (Weyl group) uniqueness argument. The only S\u2083-invariant 2\u00d72 symmetric matrix is proportional to I\u2082. Normalization c = 1/12 follows from matching weight space distances.",
      "key_insight": "S\u2083 acts on T\u00b2 by color permutations. Fisher metric inherits this symmetry from the interference pattern."
    },
    "I2": {
      "description": "12 directions on 2D torus",
      "status": "RESOLVED",
      "resolution": "The 12 directions come from the A\u2082\u2192A\u2083 embedding. A\u2082 has 6 roots (directions on T\u00b2). The extension to 3D via Proposition 0.0.16a embeds this into A\u2083, which has 12 roots (FCC nearest neighbors).",
      "key_insight": "The Cartan torus T\u00b2 is 2D, but its embedding into 3D spatial lattice introduces 6 additional directions from the stacking dimension."
