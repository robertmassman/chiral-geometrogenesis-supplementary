  "correction": "\nISSUE M2 RESOLUTION:\n\nERROR IDENTIFIED:\nSection 5.1.2 states the stella can be viewed \"as vertices of an octahedron.\"\nThis is INCORRECT because:\n- Stella octangula has 8 vertices\n- Octahedron has only 6 vertices\n\nCORRECT INTERPRETATION:\nThe stella octangula relates to the octahedron in a DIFFERENT way:\n- The stella's 8 vertices = the 8 vertices of a CUBE\n- The INTERSECTION of the two tetrahedra = an OCTAHEDRON\n- The octahedron is DUAL to the cube\n\nRECOMMENDED FIX:\nChange line 343 from:\n  \"3. As vertices of an octahedron\"\nTo:\n  \"3. As containing an inscribed octahedron (the intersection region)\"\n\nOr alternatively:\n  \"3. As related to the octahedron (dual to the circumscribing cube)\"\n\nThis preserves the triality theme while being geometrically accurate.\n",
