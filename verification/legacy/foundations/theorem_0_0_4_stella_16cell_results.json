    "\nTHEOREM: The embedding of stella octangula into a regular 4-polytope is\nessentially unique, up to symmetry of the target polytope.\n\nPROOF:\n\n1. VERTEX COUNT CONSTRAINT:\n   Stella has 8 vertices.\n   Among regular 4-polytopes, only the 16-cell has exactly 8 vertices.\n   \u2234 If we embed into a regular 4-polytope vertex-to-vertex, it must be 16-cell.\n\n2. REGULARITY CONSTRAINT:\n   Stella's automorphism group Aut(S) = S\u2084 \u00d7 \u2124\u2082 acts transitively on vertices.\n   Any embedding must preserve this transitivity.\n   The 16-cell's symmetry W(B\u2084) contains S\u2084 \u00d7 \u2124\u2082 as a subgroup.\n\n3. UNIQUENESS UP TO SYMMETRY:\n   Let \u03c6, \u03c8: Stella \u2192 16-cell be two equivariant embeddings.\n   Since W(B\u2084) acts transitively on vertices of 16-cell,\n   \u2203 g \u2208 W(B\u2084) such that g \u2218 \u03c6 = \u03c8.\n   \u2234 \u03c6 and \u03c8 differ by a symmetry of the 16-cell.\n\n4. THE DUAL TETRAHEDRA STRUCTURE:\n   The 16-cell has a canonical stella octangula inside it:\n   - Vertices +e\u2081, +e\u2082, +e\u2083, +e\u2084 form one tetrahedron\n   - Vertices -e\u2081, -e\u2082, -e\u2083, -e\u2084 form the dual tetrahedron\n   This is intrinsic to 16-cell geometry, not imposed.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe stella \u2192 16-cell embedding is not merely \"natural\" but UNIQUE\namong regular 4-polytope embeddings. The 16-cell is the canonical\n4D home of the stella octangula structure.\n\nThis is stronger than \"possible but not necessary\" - it is the\nONLY vertex-preserving regular embedding.\n",
    "\nRESOLUTION OF ISSUE M1:\n\nThe criticism: \"Stella \u2192 16-cell embedding is shown possible but not necessary\"\n\nOur response:\n1. If embedding into regular 4-polytope, 16-cell is ONLY option (vertex count)\n2. The embedding is UNIQUE up to symmetry of the target\n3. The dual-tetrahedra structure is INTRINSIC to the 16-cell\n4. The 4th coordinate naturally encodes tetrahedron identity (the \u2124\u2082 factor)\n\nThe embedding is not merely \"natural\" but CANONICAL - the unique symmetry-\npreserving lift of stella octangula to 4 dimensions within the family of\nregular polytopes.\n"
