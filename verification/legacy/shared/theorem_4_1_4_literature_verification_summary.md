## Novel Claims vs Prior Work

### CG Novel Contributions (Properly Distinguished)

1. **Dynamic suspension equilibrium** — Novel geometric interpretation unifying MIT bag pressure and Skyrme solitons
2. **Scale-dependent string tension** — σ_eff = 0.236 GeV² (short-range) vs σ = 0.18 GeV² (long-range)
3. **Hadronic resonances as pressure oscillation modes** — Novel CG perspective on Skyrme vibrations

### Credit Assessment

✅ **Appropriate credit given to prior work**
✅ **Clear distinction between established physics and CG interpretation**
✅ **No overclaiming of originality**

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
**NONE**

### Important Issues
**NONE**

### Minor Issues

1. **Missing explicit citation for Cornell potential**
   - Recommendation: Add Eichten et al., PRD 17, 3090 (1978); PRD 21, 203 (1980)
   - Severity: MINOR (well-known reference)

2. **Incomplete citation for Ji (1995)**
   - Current: "Ji (1995)"
   - Recommendation: X. Ji, PRL 74, 1071 (1995)
   - Severity: MINOR

3. **Proton radius citation inconsistency**
   - Statement §1.3 uses CODATA 2022
   - Applications §9.2 cites CODATA 2018
   - Recommendation: Standardize to CODATA 2022 throughout
   - Severity: MINOR

## Final Verdict

**VERIFIED:** YES (with minor citation completions recommended)

**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH

**LITERATURE ACCURACY:** All cited papers are standard references; no fabricated citations; proper credit to prior work

## Verification Limitations

⚠️ **Web search unavailable:** Could not verify citations by directly accessing papers. Verification based on:
- Local reference data cache (PDG 2024, CODATA 2022)
- Cross-references in project verification files
- Standard knowledge of well-known references

Despite this limitation, confidence is HIGH because:
- All numerical values verified against authoritative sources (PDG, CODATA)
- All citations are to well-known, standard papers in the field
- Repeated correct usage of same citations across multiple project files
- No contradictions with established physics identified
