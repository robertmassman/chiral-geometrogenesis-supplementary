  "research_item": "9.1.14",
  "executive_summary": "\n    RESEARCH QUESTION: Does there exist a toric CY3 X with \u03c7(X) = -144\n    admitting a freely-acting S\u2084 symmetry?\n\n    SIGNIFICANCE: If yes, then X/S\u2084 would have \u03c7 = -6, giving exactly\n    3 generations. The stella octangula has S\u2084 \u00d7 Z\u2082 symmetry, making\n    this a natural connection to the CG framework.\n\n    CURRENT STATUS: OPEN QUESTION\n    - No freely-acting S\u2084 has been found on any toric CY3 hypersurface\n    - Maximum freely-acting symmetry order found: 4 (Z\u2082\u00d7Z\u2082) for h\u00b9\u00b9 \u2264 3\n    - The K-S database (473M polytopes) has not been systematically\n      searched for h\u00b9\u00b9 \u2265 4 with automorphism analysis\n\n    CONSTRAINTS:\n    - S\u2084 can embed in Aut(16-cell), but 16-cell CY has \u03c7 = -128 \u2260 -144\n    - S\u2084 can embed in Aut(24-cell), but 24-cell CY has \u03c7 = 0\n    - CICYs have max freely-acting order 18 < 24 = |S\u2084|\n\n    RECOMMENDATION:\n    1. Use CYTools Docker to search h\u00b9\u00b9 = 4, h\u00b2\u00b9 = 76 polytopes\n    2. Compute automorphisms for each\n    3. Check for S\u2084 subgroup using GAP\n    4. If S\u2084 found, verify free action (no fixed points)\n\n    EXPECTED OUTCOME: Likely negative (no S\u2084 freely-acting on toric CY3),\n    but a definitive search would close this avenue and redirect\n    research toward the T'/SL(2,3) modular symmetry interpretation\n    (Appendix G of the main document).\n    ",
