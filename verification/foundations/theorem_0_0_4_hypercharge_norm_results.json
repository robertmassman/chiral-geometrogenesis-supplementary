  "clarification": "\nISSUE m2 RESOLUTION:\n\nThe theorem uses Y = (1/\u221a15) diag(-1/3, -1/3, -1/3, 1/2, 1/2).\n\nThis is a VALID normalization, though it differs from the \"standard GUT\"\nconvention of \u221a(3/5) that gives Tr(Y\u00b2) = 1/2.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTION:\n\nAdd a footnote or clarification:\n\n\"Note on normalization: We use Y = (1/\u221a15) diag(-1/3, -1/3, -1/3, 1/2, 1/2).\nThis is equivalent to the standard convention Y' = \u221a(3/5) \u00d7 Y_unnormalized\nup to a constant factor. The physical hypercharge values (determining\nelectric charges via Q = T\u2083 + Y) are unchanged by this choice.\nThe standard GUT normalization gives Tr(Y'\u00b2) = 1/2; our normalization\ngives Tr(Y\u00b2) = 1/18. Both are consistent internal conventions.\"\n\nOR simply change to standard convention:\n\nY = \u221a(3/5) \u00d7 diag(-1/3, -1/3, -1/3, 1/2, 1/2)\n\nEither option is acceptable. The key is CONSISTENCY within the document.\n",
