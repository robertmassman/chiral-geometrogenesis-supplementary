ABSTRACT DEFINITION: The Killing form B(X,Y) = Tr(ad_X \u2218 ad_Y) is defined\n       using the adjoint representation, which exists for ANY Lie algebra via:\n       ad_X(Y) = [X, Y]\n\n       The \"trace\" here is over the Lie algebra itself (viewed as vector space),\n       not over any particular matrix representation.\n\n    2. MATRIX CONVENIENCE: We use 3\u00d73 matrices for computational convenience,\n       but the mathematical content is independent of this choice.\n\n    PROPER STATEMENT:\n\n    The theorem should be reframed as:\n\n    \"Given the abstract SU(3) Lie algebra (defined by structure constants),\n     the Killing form induces a UNIQUE positive-definite inner product on\n     weight space. This inner product is Euclidean.\n\n     When we realize SU(3) geometrically via the stella octangula, the\n     embedding space inherits this Euclidean structure.\"\n\n    This is NOT circular because:\n    - The Killing form is computed from structure constants alone\n    - No matrix representation is logically required\n    - The Euclidean structure is OUTPUT, not INPUT\n\n    WHAT IS TRULY ASSUMED:\n    - The abstract SU(3) Lie algebra exists\n    - We want to realize it geometrically in physical space\n\n    WHAT IS DERIVED:\n    - The metric structure of the realization must be Euclidean",

RUNNING COUPLING:\n       \u03b1_s(\u03bc) runs with energy scale \u03bc via the beta function:\n       \u03bc d\u03b1_s/d\u03bc = \u03b2(\u03b1_s) = -(\u03b2_0/2\u03c0) \u03b1_s\u00b2 + O(\u03b1_s\u00b3)\n\n       Normalization conventions (updated 2026-01-19):\n       - Standard: \u03b2_0 = 11 - 2N_f/3 = 9 (for N_f = 3) [PDG, most textbooks]\n       - Alternative: b_0 = \u03b2_0/(4\u03c0) \u2248 0.716 [some lattice papers]\n       This document uses the standard convention: \u03b2_0 = 9\n\n    3. UV/IR CORRESPONDENCE:\n       The radial coordinate r is conjugate to energy \u03bc:\n       r \u221d 1/\u03bc  (or more precisely, r \u221d 1/(\u03bc - \u039b_QCD))\n\n       - r \u2192 0: High energy (UV), asymptotic freedom\n       - r \u2192 \u221e: Low energy (IR), confinement\n\n    4.
