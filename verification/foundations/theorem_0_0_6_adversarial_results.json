    "confidence_justification": "\n        The theorem's mathematical structure is sound. Key challenges:\n        1. Vertex-transitivity assumption is physically motivated but could use stronger proof\n        2. Lattice spacing 0.44847 fm is phenomenological, not derived\n        3. Lorentz violation suppression claim needs careful treatment\n\n        The framework correctly acknowledges these as irreducible inputs or future work.\n        Citations are accurate. No fragmentation with other theorems found.\n        "
