They predict proton lifetimes \u03c4_p ~ 10^34-36 years, consistent with\n   current bounds\n2. They naturally include right-handed neutrinos\n3. They have automatic anomaly cancellation per generation\n4. They are not excluded by current experimental data\n\nThe geometric derivation thus predicts an experimentally viable GUT\nstructure, strengthening rather than weakening the physical interpretation.\n\n---\n",
