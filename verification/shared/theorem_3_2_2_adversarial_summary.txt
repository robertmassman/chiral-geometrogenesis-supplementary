ADVERSARIAL VERIFICATION SUMMARY: THEOREM 3.2.2
================================================================================

VERIFIED: PARTIAL

CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM

PHYSICAL ISSUES FOUND:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. [RESOLVED] χ* resonance width Γ/m ~ 1 - Interpreted as continuum
   threshold, not sharp resonance. Physically reasonable.

2. [REQUIRES CLARIFICATION] Multi-scale structure: Λ_QCD ~ 1 GeV vs
   Λ_EW ~ 4-10 TeV. Theorem should clarify if same or different scales.

3. [NEEDS VERIFICATION] S_4 × Z_2 → custodial SU(2) connection not
   rigorously derived. S_4 is discrete, SU(2) is continuous.

MEDIUM ISSUES:
1. HL-LHC sensitivity to form factors is marginal (5% effect vs 10%
   precision). May not be testable until FCC.

2. Cutoff scale Λ derived from multiple approaches gives different
   values (350 GeV naive, 3.1 TeV loop factor, 5 TeV geometric,
   8.1 TeV from f_π). Range 4-10 TeV is conservative but uncertain.


EXPERIMENTAL TENSIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
W mass (Λ = 5 TeV):
  CG prediction: 80.3960 GeV
  CMS (2024): 80.3602 ± 0.0099 GeV
  Tension: 3.61σ
  Status: TENSION

Oblique parameters (Λ = 5 TeV):
  S: 0.0890 vs -0.01 ± 0.10 (0.99σ)
  T: 0.0764 vs 0.03 ± 0.12 (0.39σ)
  All consistent: True


LIMIT CHECKS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E << Λ limit (E = 1 TeV, Λ = 5 TeV):
  Expansion parameter (E/Λ)²: 0.040000
  δm_W: 38.98 MeV
  Well-suppressed: False

Λ → ∞ limit:
  δm_W at Λ = 100 TeV: 0.0974 MeV
  δκ_λ at Λ = 100 TeV: 0.000018
  Converges to SM: True


FRAMEWORK CONSISTENCY:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theorem 3.2.1 consistency:
  Λ ranges consistent: True
  Wilson coefficients match: True

Theorem 3.1.1 consistency:
  Λ_QCD ~ 1 GeV
  Λ_EW ~ 5000 GeV
  Scale hierarchy: 5000
  Requires clarification: True


OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✓ PASSES: Experimental consistency (W mass, oblique parameters)
✓ PASSES: Limiting cases (E << Λ, Λ → ∞)
✓ PASSES: Lorentz invariance
✓ PASSES: Unitarity preservation
✓ PASSES: Higgs coupling measurements

⚠ PARTIAL: Custodial symmetry protection (S_4 → SU(2) needs proof)
⚠ PARTIAL: Multi-scale structure (Λ_QCD vs Λ_EW unclear)
⚠ PARTIAL: HL-LHC testability (marginal sensitivity)

RECOMMENDATION:
- Theorem is PHYSICALLY CONSISTENT with current data
- Predictions are TESTABLE at future colliders (FCC-ee, FCC-hh)
- Three issues require clarification before publication:
  1. Rigorously derive custodial symmetry from S_4 × Z_2
  2. Clarify multi-scale structure (separate Λ for QCD/EW?)
  3. Improve cutoff scale derivation (reconcile different estimates)

CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM-HIGH
  (High on experimental consistency, Medium on theoretical rigor)
