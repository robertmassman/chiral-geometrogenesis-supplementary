If S_\u03bc\u03bd k^\u03bc k^\u03bd = 0 for all null vectors k^\u03bc,\nthen S_\u03bc\u03bd = f g_\u03bc\u03bd for some scalar function f.\n\nProof Sketch:\n1. In local Lorentz coordinates, null vectors have form k = (1, n\u0302) where |n\u0302| = 1.\n\n2. The constraint S_\u03bc\u03bd k^\u03bc k^\u03bd = 0 becomes:\n   S_00 - 2 S_0i n^i + S_ij n^i n^j = 0  for all unit vectors n\u0302.\n\n3. Since this must hold for ALL unit vectors n\u0302:\n   a) Coefficient of n^i: S_0i = 0 (no time-space components)\n   b) Angular average: S_ij n^i n^j = (1/3) S_kk (trace/3 for all n\u0302)\n      This requires S_ij = (S_kk/3) \u03b4_ij (isotropic)\n   c) Constant term: S_00 = S_kk/3\n\n4. Combined: S_\u03bc\u03bd = (S_kk/3) \u03b7_\u03bc\u03bd where \u03b7 is Minkowski metric.\n   Setting f = -S_00 = S_kk/3, we get S_\u03bc\u03bd = f \u03b7_\u03bc\u03bd.\n\n5. In curved spacetime, the same argument applies in local Riemann normal\n   coordinates, giving S_\u03bc\u03bd = f g_\u03bc\u03bd.\n\nApplication to Einstein Equations:\nIf (T_\u03bc\u03bd - (c\u2074/8\u03c0G) R_\u03bc\u03bd) k^\u03bc k^\u03bd = 0 for all null k, then:\n   T_\u03bc\u03bd - (c\u2074/8\u03c0G) R_\u03bc\u03bd = f g_\u03bc\u03bd\nfor some scalar f. Conservation then fixes f = (c\u2074/16\u03c0G)R - \u039b.\n",

THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT PROBLEM\n   Sakharov's approach naturally produces a huge cosmological constant\n   \u039b_bare ~ \u039b_UV\u2074, which must somehow cancel.\n\nCONNECTION TO CHIRAL GEOMETROGENESIS:\n\n| Aspect | Sakharov (1967) | Theorem 5.2.3 |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Gravity origin | Quantum fluctuations | Thermodynamic equilibrium |\n| Newton's G | From UV cutoff | From f_\u03c7 = M_P/\u221a(8\u03c0) |\n| Microscopic DOF | Generic QFT | SU(3) chiral phases |\n| \u039b problem | Unresolved | Resolved via vacuum cancellation |\n| Temperature | Not relevant | Unruh temperature T = \u210fa/(2\u03c0c) |\n\nHISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE:\n\nSakharov's paper established that gravity COULD be emergent rather than\nfundamental. This opened the door for:\n- Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation (1995)\n- Verlinde's entropic gravity (2011)\n- Padmanabhan's emergent gravity program\n- The current Chiral Geometrogenesis framework\n\nThe key advance of Theorem 5.2.3 over Sakharov is providing SPECIFIC\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom (chiral field phases) and deriving the\nEinstein equations from thermodynamics rather than effective field theory.\n",
