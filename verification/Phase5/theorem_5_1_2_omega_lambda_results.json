    "explanation": "\u03a9_\u039b = 0.685 follows from closure (\u03a9_total=1) plus matter content. The value is not arbitrary - it is fixed by inflation (flatness), nucleosynthesis (\u03a9_b), and DM abundance (\u03a9_DM). Within holographic framework, this is a CONSISTENCY CHECK rather than a free parameter.",
    "remaining_question": "To fully derive \u03a9_\u039b from first principles, we need to derive \u03a9_m, which requires: (1) baryon asymmetry from CP violation, (2) DM abundance from freeze-out or alternative mechanism."
