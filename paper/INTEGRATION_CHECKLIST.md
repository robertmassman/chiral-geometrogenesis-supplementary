## ✅ Phase 0 Complete

**Phase 0 completion verified:** 2026-01-06

The unified paper is ready for Phase 1 (arXiv submission). Key accomplishments:
- All three tasks (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) completed
- Paper compiles without errors
- All internal references resolve
- Notation is consistent
- 6 figures integrated, 30 more available

## Next Steps (Phase 1)

1. **Final proofread** — Review abstract and all sections for clarity
2. **Add more figures** — Select 8-10 more figures from the 30 available
3. **Expand bibliography** — Add 30-40 more relevant citations
4. **Prepare repository** — Create public GitHub release
5. **Submit to arXiv** — Categories: hep-th (primary), math-ph, gr-qc
